##### Java
 - what are the data types
 - String equality
 - GC - when does the world stops
 - Java heaps - memory

**Whiteboard** Find popular name in a List of names. Most frequently name in a List


##### Linux

- what is ls.
    + list all the commands
 - Commands to see processesps commands and jobs command
     + top
     + ps -ef
     + GUI : System monitor (GNOME, KDE System -> Monitor)
     + kill -9 to terminate.
 - Error in file access. (File Permission)
     + Ownership permission (ugo -> USER, GROUP & OTHER)
     + Viweing Permission (r=4; w=2; x=1)
     + eg: 700 (rwx for u, none got g,o)
     + chmod for changing file permission (chmod 771 file.exe)
 - what is there in exe Folder.
     + *[Important Linux Files]({% post_url 2016-04-14-linux-files %})*.
 - grep : Search a pettern in File.
     + `grep ‘pattern to search’ file1 file2`
     + `grep -i -n ‘administrator’  file1.txt`
     + Ignoring the case ( -i)
     + Displaying line Numbers  ( -n )
 - How can u find a pattern and how to do recursively
     + grep -r "texthere" .
     + Recursively search "texthere" in PWD.
 - Given directory hierarchy. Find a file.
     + `find / -name 'program.c' 2>errors.txt`
         * Start searching from the root directory (i.e / directory)
         * `-name` : Given search text is the filename rather than any other attribute of a file
         * `'program.c'` Search text that we have entered. Always enclose the filename in single quotes.. why to do this is complex.. so simply do so.
         * `$ find /mp3collection -name '*.mp3' -size -5000k` find in /mp3collection, only those mp3 files that have a size less than 5000 Kilobytes ( < 5MB)
         * `$ find / -size +10000k` search from the / directory for any file that is larger than 10000k (> 10MB)
 - how do u connect to remove server securely.
     + `ssh remote_username@remote_host`
     + SSH keys should be generated on the computer you wish to log in from. This is usually your local computer. Enter the following into the command line. `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
 - remove the file from remote server      
     + `ssh username@domain.com 'rm /some/where/some_file.war'`
 - difference between move and copy
     + mv displaces the file, cp makes a new copy
 - diff : compare the two files.
     + cmp returns first occurrence of difference
     + diff returns all differences
 - Distributions & version of Linux
     + Fedora/RedHat based : Fedora 23, Cent OS
     + Debian Based : Ubuntu 15 LTS
     + Mac OS is based on a BSD code base
 - What is GNOME.
     + GNOME desktop and KDE

##### Hibernate
 - Disadvantage of Hibernate
<pre>
1. Not that flexible when it comes to mapping composite-ids (although you can do a lot). While this is not a fault of Hibernate as composite-ids are typically used in legacy systems, it can be a pain when attempting to map legacy tables.

2. Everything is an object. If you need only a portion of data (say, for a search), you would still have to retrieve the object. However, this is true for any ORM strategy.

3. In some cases, you will encounter the (n+1) select problem. That is, Hibernate will execute (n+1) queries for going through a list of records of size n. There are some mechanisms suggested by Hibernate that can be used to mitigate this risk.

4. Till Hibernate 3, you cannot map multiple tables to a single class. This has been fixed in Hibernate 3 using the join tag.

 - Hibernate over JDBC
     + Make software database independent. Can replace any other database with this.


##### Spring
 - What is Dependency Injection
<pre>IOC(Inversion Of Controller):   Giving control to the container to get instance of object is called Inversion of Control.,
    • means instead of you are creating object using new operator, let the container do that for you.

DI(Dependency Injection):  Decoupling by passing an object to a function rather than CREATING the object the circle inside the method.
Way of injecting properties to an object is called Dependency injection.

    We have three types of Dependency injection
        1)  Constructor Injection : Constructor-based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency on other class.
        2)  Setter/Getter Injection : Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.
        3)  Interface Injection
Spring support only Constructor Injection and Setter/Getter Injection.
