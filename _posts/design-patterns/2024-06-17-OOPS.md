## 4 OOPS principle

**Encapsulation** - encapsulation means Data Hiding + Abstraction

**Abstraction** - Abstraction means hiding the implementation,

**Inheritance** - Inheritance is a process where child class acquires the
properties of super class, and (both interface and abstract class)

**Polymorphism** - Property of an object to take on different forms
- **Static polymorphism or Compile time polymorphism or early binding**
  - using **Method overloading** by implements 
- **Runtime polymorphism or Late Binding** 
  - Method overriding - by extends (using an object of type parent)


Class of an object v/s #ype of object

# Type -> Abstraction --> Interface

**Interface**: is the ability to describe a behavior or a contract between a
client and provider
without bothering about implementation symantics

**Class**: Blueprint of an object

- codification of logic &
- encapsulation of state
- STATE + BEHAVIOUR

> Runtime object will have both type and class

In java, first class support for abstraction like interface

**LHS = type | RHS = Class**

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

# Key takeaway & basis for most GOF patterns

- program to an interface, not an implementation
- favor object composition over class inheritance
    - Better to do delegation using object composition rather than use class
      inheritance

# Interface

- 100% Abstraction - except default methods
- only constants and abstract methods - except default methods
- Intent : to specify behavior of object
- CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED
- All data fields are public final & static
- All methods are public and abstract
- Multiple inheritance is possible via Interfaces, can extend (implement) two
  interfaces in java
- An interface can extend only an interface
- Are used to create an API which can be implemented by different parties. - JPA

> Interfaces are a good substitute for multiple inheritance

# Abstract Class

- Can't be instantiated
- public because need to be given out
- still define its constructors => invoked in constructors of subclass.
- 0 to 100% abstraction
- eg: `java.lang.Number` class

You Program for Interfaces (interfaces as well as abstract class to provide
abstraction)
rather than implementation

Abstraction is applied in the process of identifying s/w artifacts to
model the problem domain

The Chef analogy : Customer -> (Menu) + Waiter (can be a cook) -> Head chef ->
{indian, chinese, Italian, Mexican} ->> multiple cooks

- any0one can leave from the junior chefs and new can come. Customers need not
  be worried

REAL AIM : FLEXIBILITY (code can be changed but the abstraction remains the
same) and not hiding
Segregation of code, free to change without affecting the business
Constructor chaining <=> for inheritance

> IT IS POLYMORPHISM WHICH LINKS ABSTRACT CODE TO CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION.

```java
List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();
```

# Constructors

whenever an object of a class is created, implicitly **default no-arg
constructor**
of class and its superclass constructor is called.

Implicitly, the first statement of constructor is super().
