title: Factory Design Pattern

{% include toc title="Index" %}

# Factory pattern

Polymorphism
extensibility

What is the worst keyword in Java from polymorphism angle

* final
* instanceof
* static

**new**

new ClassNAme() //tight coupling
So many patterns to fight with new, especially in Spring

new introduces tight coupleing. New is not poluymorphic in Java, C++, .Net but
its is Ruby

Python or Kotlin doesn't even have new

Golden Rule : interfaces are better than abstract classes

Interfaces can have implementations (default methods) however they cannot have
non final fields
Interfaces cannot carry state but an abstract class carry a state.

# Abstract Factory vs. Factory Method

Class vs method

Factory Method : A class or an interface relies on a derived class to provide
the implementation whereas
the base provides the common behavior

uses inheritance as design tool
uses factory METHOD

Abstract Factory uses delegation as design tool
