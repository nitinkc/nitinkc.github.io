# Writing Testable Code

No Curly in lambdas

* Discipline to write code
* modularizing the code to smaller cohesive functions
* not to write Lambdas that are a beast
* make Lambda as a glue
  code - http://blog.agiledeveloper.com/2015/06/lambdas-are-glue-code.html
* use the test to be able to debug the code
* Write code using tests - Test first development

Use polymorphism rather than type checking - avoid instance of at all costs

//Exception handling is imperative stype of programming

//In function programmingm we deal with the stream of Data - data flow

hand it over to downstreams - flat type return car rental

reactive has error channel

handle the exception **as error** rather than exception

# Mike Cohen's Test Pyramid

- write tests with different granularity
- the higher you go up the pyramid, the fewer tests you should have
- 70% unit tests, 20% service tests, 10% UI tests
