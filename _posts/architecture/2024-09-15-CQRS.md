Command Service for DB Writes/Data Mutation

Query Service for DB Reads/Data Read Operations

Both have it own database so it needs to be kept synchronized

# CQRS Synchronization

- With Message Brokers between command and query service
    - need to ensure that both data read and write to a message queue happens as
      a transaction
    - via the transactional outbox pattern
- Function as a Service

# Drawbacks

- CQRS can only guarantee Eventual Consistency
- Overhead and Complexity

# CQRS + Materialized Views

> for complicated joins between 2 different tables in two different databases.

Create a third "**Search Service**"

The Search service will already have the **Materialized Views** (with the pre
calculated joined data) in its search DB

All DB's updated via Messaging Queue
