{% include toc title="Index" %}

Java compiler code optimization involves various techniques applied by the Java
compiler (`javac`) and
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to enhance the performance and efficiency of the
generated bytecode.

These optimizations can be categorized into

- compile-time optimizations,
- runtime optimizations, and
- JVM-specific optimizations

# 1. Compile-Time Optimizations

### Constant Folding and Propagation

Evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than runtime. For
instance, `2 + 3` is replaced with `5`.

```java
int x = 2 + 3;  // Optimized to int x = 5;
```

### Dead Code Elimination

Removes code that is never executed or has no effect, reducing the bytecode
size.

```java
int a = 10;
if (false) {
    a = 20;  // This code is never executed and is removed.
}
```

### Method Inlining

Replaces a method call with the method's actual code to reduce method call
overhead.

```java
// Original code
int result = computeValue(5);

// After inlining
int result = 5 * 2;  // Assuming computeValue(x) returns x * 2
```

### Loop Unrolling

Expands loops to minimize loop control overhead and improve performance.

```java
// Original loop
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    process(i);
}

// After unrolling
process(0);
process(1);
process(2);
process(3);
```

# 2. Runtime Optimizations

### Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

[https://nitinkc.github.io/java/performance%20engineering/JVM-Compilation/#jit---just-in-time-compilation](https://nitinkc.github.io/java/performance%20engineering/JVM-Compilation/#jit---just-in-time-compilation)
Converts bytecode to native machine code at runtime, allowing optimizations
based on actual usage.

- Frequently called methods may be compiled to native code for faster execution.

### Adaptive Optimization

Monitors code performance and applies optimizations based on profiling data. Hot
methods may receive further optimization.

- The HotSpot JVM optimizes code paths that are frequently executed using
  profiling information.

# 3. JVM-Specific Optimizations

### Escape Analysis

Determines if an object is used only within a single thread or method,
optimizing memory allocation.

- Objects used only locally within a method might be allocated on the stack
  instead of the heap.

### Inlining and Devirtualization

The JVM can inline method calls and eliminate virtual method dispatch when
possible.

- If a method is called on a specific class only, the JVM can inline it and
  avoid the overhead of virtual method dispatch.

### Garbage Collection Optimization**:

Optimizes memory management and garbage collection to minimize pauses and
overhead.

- The JVM uses various garbage collectors (e.g., G1, CMS) to reduce the impact
  of garbage collection on application performance.

### Summary

Java compiler and JVM optimizations work together to improve the efficiency of
Java applications. Key techniques include:

- **Compile-Time Optimizations**: Constant folding, dead code elimination,
  method inlining, and loop unrolling.
- **Runtime Optimizations**: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and adaptive
  optimization.
- **JVM-Specific Optimizations**: Escape analysis, inlining, devirtualization,
  and garbage collection optimizations.
