# Type inference

- helps remove the noise from the code
- IDE's provides the **hover and know** feature to know the type of the object.
- allows the compiler to know the type about

```java
var test = "test";
test.foo();
```

Notice the compile time log : _location: variable test of **type String**_

```java
error: cannot find symbol
      test.foo();
          ^
symbol:   method foo()
location: variable test of type String
```

notice in
the [byte code](https://nitinkc.github.io/shortcuts/intelliJ-Debug-tricks/#show-bytecode)
`LOCALVARIABLE test Ljava/lang/String; L1 L2 1`

```java
 public static main([Ljava/lang/String;)V
   L0
    LINENUMBER 5 L0
    LDC "test"
    ASTORE 1
   L1
    LINENUMBER 7 L1
    RETURN
   L2
    LOCALVARIABLE[] args
 Ljava/lang/String; L0 L2 0
    LOCALVARIABLE test Ljava/lang/String; L1 L2 1
    MAXSTACK = 1
    MAXLOCALS = 2
```

### Use of type inference

When the response is **_received from a call of a method or a service_**, use
type inference because its type
is determined by the return type of the method or the service being called.

# Arrays asList add() vs set()

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3);// does not support add method
System.out.println(numbers.getClass());//class java.util.Arrays$ArrayList

try{
    numbers.add(4);//this fails
} catch (Exception e){
    System.out.println("add unsupported ");//This runs, as add is not supported in Arrays.asList()
}

try {
    numbers.set(2, 2);//This works
} catch (Exception ex) {
 System.out.println("set() unsupported");
}
```

### Static of()

Quit using `Arrays.asList` and start using `List.of()`, **the immutable variant
**. Similarly, use Static Factories `Set.of()` and `Map.of()`.

* The Set's `of()` does not permit duplicate
* the `of` methods does not permit nulls.
    * IDE Warns : `Passing 'null' argument to parameter annotated as @NotNull`
    * throws `NullPointerException` if null is tried to be inserted

Immutability makes it safe to make a copy and safe to share. the Of() factory
methods are smart. If the collection is truly immutable, it shares a reference
instead of duplicating.

### remove

Be careful while using the var

```java
Collection<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(getIntegers());
numbers.remove(1);//Removes the Object => //[2, 3]

var numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(getIntegers());
numbers.remove(1);//overloaded Remove method that takes Integer instead of Object
//[1, 3]
```

# Function Purity - Shared Mutability

```java
List<String> words = getData(url);//Add more data
List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();//Shared Mutable Variable

words
    .parallelStream() //Gives problem 
    //.stream
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .forEach(name -> result.add(name));//Shared Mutability is BAD
```

- The execution is always lazy in Java or C#.
    - For Kotlin and Scala you can choose between eager and lazy
        - In Kotlin, by default, its eager evaluation. if using `asSequence()`,
          then its lazy
- Functional programming relies on lazy evaluation for **efficiency**
- Lazy evaluation relies on **purity of functions** for correctness.

Programmers need to make sure that **Lambdas are pure**

### Rule for purity

Rule 1 is necessary but not sufficient

1. **No shared mutability** :  The function does not make any change that is
   visible outside
2. The function does not depend on anything that may change from outside

### Parallel Stream

```java
//Which Thread will transform run
List.of(1,2,3).stream()
        .parallel()
        .map(number -> transform(number))
        .sequential()
        .forEach(number -> print(number));
```

Java 8 streams do not segment the pipeline for different threading model. The *
*last setting** overrides the entire
pipeline.

**Reactive streams** segment the pipeline for different threading model.

# Inheritance

Do not do **anything serious in the constructor**, especially do not call *
*virtual method**

**Lesson from effective Java**: Make the constructor simple and private and make
the Factory method create it. By the
time you get to the Factory method, the constructor would have been completed.

```java
class Base{
    public Base(){//Constructor
        System.out.println("In base");
        check();// The check of the Derived is called
    }
    public void check(){}
}

class Derived extends Base {
    private final String value;

    public Derived(String value) {
        System.out.println("In Derived");
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public void check() {
        if (value.length() == 0) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Null Value");
        }
    }
}


public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        new Derived("");//Null Pointer exception
    } catch (Exception e){
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

# toList or .collect(Collectors.toList())

It is better to use **toList** directly in the stream rather than
`.collect(Collectors.toList())`

```java
.toList();//Immutable List
.collect(Collectors.toList()); //Mutable
.collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList())//Immutable
```

# Records

```java
record Year(int year){
    //Avoid Canonical constructors as much as possible.
    // Use the compact constructor instead
    //Compact constructor is a filter or a pre-processor before the constructor is called.

    //code -->  Compact constructor --> constructor.
    
    Year {
        if(year < 0){
            throw new RuntimeException("Negative Year");
        }
        if(year < 100){
            //this.year = 2000 + year;//This is not available yet
            year = 2000 + year;
        }
    }
}
```

# CopyOf

asList creates a mutable List
ofList creates immutable

What is immutable is safe to share - returns the same reference to it
What is immutable is safe to copy - it never changes ever

Stock price at an instant of time is immutable

In Domain Driven Design, the value objects are expected to be immutable

# Teeing

# Exceptions

### catch expressions (introduced in Java 16) and

**Use Case** : well-suited for simple exception handling cases without complex
logic or control flow change

* Catch expressions are limited to a single expression, so cannot use control
  flow statements directly within the catch expression.

```java
// Using Catch Expressions (Java 16+)
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) -> System.err.println("Arithmetic Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
```

* Encapsulate any control flow logic within a separate method or code block and
  call it from catch expression

```java
try {
    int result = performComplexOperation();
} catch (CustomException e) -> logAndThrow(e);


private void logAndThrow(CustomException e) {
    System.err.println("Custom Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    logError(e);
    throw new AnotherException();
}
```

* Catch Expressions Encapsulating Control Flow

```java
try {
    int result = performComplexOperation();
} catch (CustomException e) -> {
    System.err.println("Custom Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    return; // Encapsulating control flow
}
```

### catch statements (traditional approach)

* The catch block can contain multiple statements, including control flow
  statements like return or break.
* Provides flexibility to control the program's flow after catching an exception
* **Use Cases**: Suitable for handling complex exception scenarios.
