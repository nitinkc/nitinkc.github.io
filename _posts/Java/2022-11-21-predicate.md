title: Predicate Functional Interface
---

`java.util.function.Predicate` represents a simple function that takes a single
value as parameter,
and returns true or false. Predicate uses a Lambda that returns true and false

With Streams Predicate is used with Filter. A filter processes a list in some
order to produce a new list containing exactly those elements
of the original list for which a given predicate (the Boolean expression)
returns true.

```java
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}
```

Predicate can be defined within Lambda or can be separately defined and invoked
using test method.

With multiple predicates, we can use chaining and use **type casting** with
multiple filter chaining
