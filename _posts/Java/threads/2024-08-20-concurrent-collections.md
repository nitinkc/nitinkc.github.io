# Traditional Collections and Their Limitations

In multi-threaded environments, traditional collections like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet` are .
- can lead to issues such as `ConcurrentModificationException` (one thread modifies a collection while another thread is iterating over it)
- To address these issues, Java provides **concurrent collections** in the `java.util.concurrent` package.
- **Non-Thread-Safe Collections**: Most traditional collections are not designed for concurrent access (**not thread-safe**).

## **Synchronized Wrappers**: 
Collections like `Vector` and `Hashtable` use **primitive synchronized methods**, which can lead to performance bottlenecks due to **excessive locking**.
- synchronized wrappers like `Collections.synchronizedList`, `Collections.synchronizedSet`, and `Collections.synchronizedMap` too can suffer from performance issue

##### Performance Issues with Synchronized Wrappers
- **Lock Contention**: When multiple threads attempt to access a synchronized collection, they must acquire a lock before proceeding. If one thread holds the lock, other threads are blocked until the lock is released. This contention can lead to significant delays, especially under high concurrency.
- **Single Lock for Entire Collection**: This means that even read operations, which could be performed concurrently, are serialized. This reduces the overall throughput of the application.
- **Memory Barriers**: Synchronization introduces memory barriers, which force the JVM to flush data to main memory to ensure visibility across threads. This can prevent certain optimizations and increase the overhead of synchronization.

# Concurrent/Thread-Safe Collections in Java
Java's `java.util.concurrent` package offers a variety of **thread-safe collections** designed to **handle concurrent access efficiently**:

| Collection Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                |

| **CopyOnWriteArraySet**         | Set backed by `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.                                                                                                                                      |
| **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**       | Non-blocking, FIFO queue.                                                                                                                                                  |

| **ConcurrentSkipListMap / Set** | Thread-safe, sorted concurrent map/set using skip lists.                                                                                                                              


#### 1. **ConcurrentHashMap**
- A high-performance, thread-safe hash table.
- Allows concurrent reads and updates without locking the entire map.

#### 2. **CopyOnWriteArrayList**
- A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`.
- Ideal for scenarios with **frequent reads** and **infrequent writes**.
- On write, it creates a **new copy** of the underlying array.

#### 3. **CopyOnWriteArraySet**
- Backed by a `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
- Thread-safe set with similar characteristics: good for read-heavy workloads.

#### 4. **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**
- A non-blocking, thread-safe queue based on linked nodes.
- Suitable for **FIFO** (first-in-first-out) operations in concurrent environments.

#### 5. **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**
- A thread-safe, non-blocking **double-ended queue**.
- Allows insertion and removal from both ends concurrently.

#### 6. **BlockingQueue Interface and Implementations**
Used for **producer-consumer** scenarios with blocking behavior.
- **ArrayBlockingQueue** ‚Äì bounded, backed by an array.
- **LinkedBlockingQueue** ‚Äì optionally bounded, backed by linked nodes.
- **PriorityBlockingQueue** ‚Äì unbounded, orders elements based on priority.
- **DelayQueue** ‚Äì elements become available after a delay.
- **SynchronousQueue** ‚Äì no internal capacity; each insert waits for a remove.

#### 7. **BlockingDeque Interface and Implementations**
- **LinkedBlockingDeque** ‚Äì supports blocking operations on both ends.

#### 8. **ConcurrentSkipListMap / ConcurrentSkipListSet**
- Thread-safe sorted map and set.
- Based on **skip list** data structure.
- Maintains elements in **sorted order**.

# Fail-Fast and Fail-Safe Iterators

**Fail-Fast Iterators**: These iterators throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is **structurally modified** during iteration. 
- This behavior is implemented using an internal modification count (`modCount`).
- Examples : iterators for `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, and `HashSet`.

**Fail-Safe Iterators**: These iterators operate on **a copy of the collection**, allowing modifications without throwing exceptions. 
- Examples: iterators for `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `CopyOnWriteArraySet`, and `ConcurrentSkipListSet`.

# üß© Operation-Level Locking vs Object-Level Locking
**Operation-level locking** means that the lock is applied only to the **specific operation** being performed, 
rather than locking the entire object.  

This allows multiple threads to perform different operations on the same collection **concurrently**, 
as long as those operations don‚Äôt interfere with each other.

### üîê **`ConcurrentHashMap` and Operation-Level Locking**
Instead of locking the entire map for every read or write, it uses **fine-grained locking mechanisms** to 
maximize concurrency and performance.

#### ‚úÖ **1. Lock Striping (Java 7 and earlier)**
- The map was divided into **segments** (like mini hash tables).
- Each segment had its own lock, allowing multiple threads to access different segments **simultaneously**.
- This significantly reduced contention compared to synchronizing the entire map.

#### üîÑ **2. Bucket-Level Synchronization (Java 8 and later)**
- Java 8 replaced segments with a **lock-free, bucket-based structure**.
- Internally, it uses a `Node[]` table (similar to `HashMap`) and **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** operations for atomic updates.
- For hash collisions:
   - Initially uses **linked lists**.
   - Converts to **balanced trees (TreeNodes)** when a bucket becomes too full, improving lookup performance.

#### üîç **3. Fine-Grained Synchronization**
- Only **individual buckets** are locked during updates like `put` or `remove`.
- **Read operations (`get`) are non-blocking** and extremely fast, thanks to minimal locking.

#### üß† **4. Optimistic Reads**
- `ConcurrentHashMap` uses an **optimistic locking strategy** for reads.
- Reads proceed without locking. If a concurrent modification is detected, the operation is retried with a lock to ensure consistency.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **5. Atomic Methods**
- Methods like `putIfAbsent`, `compute`, `merge`, and `computeIfAbsent` are **atomic**.
- These ensure thread-safe updates without requiring external synchronization.

### **`CopyOnWriteArrayList` and Operation-Level Locking**
operation-level locking, but in a different way:

1. **Copy on Write**: When a write operation (such as `add` or `remove`) is performed, the entire underlying array is copied.
   2. This ensures that the write operation does not interfere with ongoing read operations.
2. **Read Operations**: Since the array is copied on write, read operations can proceed **without any locking**.
   3. This makes `CopyOnWriteArrayList` very efficient for scenarios with frequent reads and infrequent writes.

## Benefits of Operation-Level Locking

1. **Improved Concurrency**: By locking only the necessary parts of the collection, multiple threads can perform operations concurrently, leading to better throughput.
2. **Reduced Contention**: Finer-grained locks reduce the likelihood of contention between threads, which can improve performance in multi-threaded environments.
3. **Scalability**: Operation-level locking allows collections to scale better with the number of threads, as different threads can work on different parts of the collection simultaneously.

# üß© Object-Level Locking

- Locks the **entire object** for every operation.
- Common in synchronized wrappers like `Collections.synchronizedList`.
- **Drawback**: Only one thread can access the collection at a time, even if operations are unrelated.
- **Result**: High contention and poor scalability in multi-threaded environments.
