title: Volatile Variable
---

{% include toc title="Index" %}

volatile variables are **stored in main memory** and their changes are visible
to all threads immediately.

- The volatile keyword **prevents the CPU from caching** the variable’s value in
  a local register or cache.

# Atomicity - No guarantee

The volatile keyword **does not guarantee atomicity** for compound operations (
e.g., incrementing a variable, count++).

- It only ensures that the latest value of the variable is visible across
  threads.
- For atomic operations, additional synchronization mechanism or atomic
  classes (like AtomicInteger) are needed.

# Guarantees `Happens-Before`

Writes to a volatile variable establish a `happens-before` relationship with
subsequent reads of that variable.

- This means that any write to a volatile variable **happens-before any
  subsequent read** of that variable,
  ensuring proper visibility and ordering of operations.

**No Reordering**: The Java Memory Model guarantees that reads and writes to
volatile variables **cannot be reordered**
with respect to other reads and writes to volatile variables.

```java
volatile int sharedVar = 0;
public void task(){
  ...//All instructions WILL be executed before
  read/write(sharedVar);
  ...//All instructions will be executed after
}
```

### Implementation Details

Here’s how the volatile keyword is typically implemented:

**Memory Barriers:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses memory barriers (or
fences) to enforce the visibility and ordering guarantees. These barriers
prevent the CPU and memory subsystem from reordering reads and writes to
volatile variables.

- Store Barrier: Ensures that writes to volatile variables aren’t reordered with
  preceding writes.
- Load Barrier: Ensures that reads of volatile variables aren’t reordered with
  following reads.
