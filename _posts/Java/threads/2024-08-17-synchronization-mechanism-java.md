### Volatile Variable

### Mutex (Lock) - ReentrantLock
A ReentrantLock is a more flexible lock than the built-in synchronized block.

**Advantages**:
- Can be unlocked in a different method or class from where it was locked.
- Provides more control over the lock (e.g., timed lock, interruptible lock).
- can maintain fairness `ReentrantLock(true)` but may come with a cost of throughput.
  use unlock in finally block so that it is always guaranteed that the resource is unlocked.

**Use Case**: When you need advanced locking features not provided by the synchronized block.

### 2. ReadWriteLock - ReentrantReadWriteLock
A ReadWriteLock allows multiple threads to read a resource concurrently but only one thread to write.

2 Types
**Advantages**:
- Improves performance in scenarios where reads are more frequent than writes.

**Use Case**: When you have a resource that is frequently read but infrequently written.

Since the method is guarded by a read lock. Many threads can acquire that lock as long as no other thread is holding the write lock

### Semaaphore

### Condition Variables
Condition variables are used with locks to allow threads to wait for certain conditions to be met.

Advantages:
- Allows for complex waiting conditions.

Use Case: When threads need to wait for specific conditions before proceeding.

### Atomic Variables
Atomic variables (e.g., AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference) provide lock-free thread-safe operations on single variables.

Advantages:
- Lower overhead compared to using locks.

Use Case: When you need to perform atomic operations on a single variable without the overhead of locking.


As part of the `java.util.concurrent` package, the JDK contains many classes that help us coordinate between threads.

A few of those include the `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Phaser`, `Exchanger`, and others that may be added in future versions
of the JDK.

However, all those classes are no more than higher-level wrappers built upon the same building blocks.
We can implement their functionality with the tools we already have.

### CountDownLatch
A CountDownLatch is used to make one or more threads wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

**Advantages**:
- Allows threads to wait for a specific condition to be met.

**Use Case**: Waiting for multiple threads to complete initialization tasks before proceeding.

### CyclicBarrier
A CyclicBarrier allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
- guarantee that some portion of the work is done by all threads before the rest of the work is performed.

### Exchanger
An Exchanger allows two threads to exchange data with each other.

Advantages:
- Useful for thread communication where each thread provides data to the other.

Use Case: Pairwise data exchange between threads.

### Phaser
A Phaser is a more flexible version of CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier.

Advantages:
- Supports dynamic registration of parties and multiple phases of synchronization.

Use Case: Complex synchronization scenarios with multiple phases and dynamic participants.

### StampedLock
A StampedLock is a lock that offers three modes for controlling read/write access.

Advantages:
- Provides an optimistic read mode, which can improve performance for read-heavy scenarios.

Use Case: When you need high-performance read access with occasional writes.

> Synchronization mechanisms like CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier can be applicable in distributed systems.

Their usage and considerations differ compared to their usage in single-process applications.
