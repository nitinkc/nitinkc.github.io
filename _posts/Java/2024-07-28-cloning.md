A clone in java, essentially means the ability to create an object with similar
state as the original object.

How to do (Ways)deep cloning in java?
â€¢ Using copy constructors
Cloning with serialization

Cloneable Interface is a marker interface

Deep Cloning -> for mutable Objects

If the Cloneable Interface is not implemented it throws
CloneNotSupportedException

Keeps a separate copy, and not a reference

Clone is protected class in Object Class, Thus override
In your class and increase visibility. In OVERRIDE you can increase the
visibility

Cloned classes implements Cloneable Interface "Marker"

If class not marked Cloneable --> CloneNotSupportedException

Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object.

* A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original
  object.
* If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects,
* just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is
  copied.
*
* FOR MUTABLE OBJECTS
* any changes made to object in main will reflect in clone.
*
* FOR IMMUTABLE OBJECTS like String Integer
* Since the state cannot be changed, it doesn't need be deeply cloned

# Shallow Cloning

Copy all fields
If field is a reference to an Object --> just copy the reference/mem address
Thus if referenced Object is changed, the clone will have the reference to the
changed object and the previous state of that object is lost

# Deep Cloning

Copy all fields and REFERENCE OBJECTS
If field is a reference to an Object --> just copy the reference/mem address

Immutable --> need not be changed, as they never change state

# Steps

	1. Implement Cloneable Interface 
	2. Override clone method making it public
	3. Class super.clone
	4. Handle ClassNotSupportedException
