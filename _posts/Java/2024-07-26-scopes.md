title: Variable Scopes in Java

{% include toc title="Index" %}

# 1. Global Scope

Variables that are accessible from anywhere in the program.

  ```java
public static final HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
```

`client` is accessible from any class or method in the program using
`ClassName.client`

# 2. Class Scope

Variables that are accessible from any method within the class.

# 3. Method Scope

Variables that are accessible only within the method they are declared.

# 4. Block Scope

Variables that are accessible only within the block they are declared.

```java
try {
    URI uri = new URI("http://httpbin.org/delay/" + secs);
    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder().GET().uri(uri).build();
} catch (IOException | URISyntaxException exp) {
    throw new RuntimeException(exp);
}
```

# 5. Local Scope

Variables declared within a method (including method parameters) and are only
accessible within that method.

```java
public void exampleMethod() {
    int localVar = 10; // local variable
}
```

# 6. Instance Scope

Variables that are associated with an instance of a class (non-static fields).

```java
private String instanceVar;
```

`instanceVar` is accessible by all methods within the instance of the class.

# 7. ThreadLocal Scope

Variables that are **local to the thread**, providing a separate variable for
each thread that accesses it.

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> dateFormat = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy"));
```

`dateFormat` provides a separate SimpleDateFormat instance for each thread that
accesses it.

# 8. Static Scope

Variables that are associated with the class rather than any instance, and are *
*shared** among all instances of the class.

```java
public static int staticVar;
```

# Final Example

```java
public class ExampleClass {
    // Global scope (static)
    public static final HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

    // Class scope (instance)
    private final String instanceVar;

    // Static scope
    public static int staticVar = 42;
    
    // ThreadLocal scope, usually static so that it is visible to all threads
    private static final ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> dateFormat 
            = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy"));//with Supplier
    //Getter and Setter will be applicable to the thread accessing it.

    private static final ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> dateFormat = new ThreadLocal<>();
    
    // Constructor
    public ExampleClass(String instanceVar) {
        this.instanceVar = instanceVar;
    }

    // Method demonstrating different scopes
    public void exampleMethod(int parameter) { // Method scope
        // Local scope
        int localVar = 10;

        try { // Block scope
            URI uri = new URI("http://example.com/" + localVar + "/" + parameter);
            HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder().GET().uri(uri).build();
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
