The **"escaping reference"** problem in Java occurs when a reference to an object is passed outside of its intended scope
or context, allowing the object's state to be modified unexpectedly. 

This problem commonly arises in situations where references to mutable objects are passed to external code or 
stored in a shared context, leading to unintended modifications that can result in bugs or unexpected behavior.

One common example of the escaping reference problem is when a reference to an object stored within 
a container (such as a collection) is returned or passed to external code **without proper encapsulation**. 

If the external code modifies the object's state directly through this reference, 
it can lead to unexpected changes affecting other parts of the program that rely on the object's original state.

To mitigate the escaping reference problem, it's important to ensure proper encapsulation and control access to mutable objects. 

This can be achieved by:

# 1. Using an Iterator
# 2. Duplicating Collections
# 3. Immutable collections

return `Collections.unmodifiableMap(records)`. Always creates a copy

Java 10 onwards - Slight performance improvement

return `Map.copyId(records)`. If records is already an unmodifiable map, then only the reference to that is returned, 
else a new copy is created

# 4. Duplicating Objects

# 5. Using Interfaces to create Immutable Objects

# 6. Using Modules to hide implementation
