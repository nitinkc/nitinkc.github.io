{% include toc title="Index" %}

Identify actual bottlenecks through load testing and profiling

Optimize only when performance of API shows issues

# 1.Caching

store the result of an expensive computation (redis or memchahed) to avoid
redoing

# 2.Connection pooling

Maintaining a pool of open connections, rathen than making new DB connection
each API Call.

Difficult to achieve this in a serverless infrastructure. Amazon RDS Proxy and
Azure SQL DB serverless
manage the connection pooling for you

# 3.N+1 Problem

When multiple queries are used to return data for a single resposne, like N
queries for each of n comments for a post

# 4.Pagination

with the use of limit and offset
to respond with one page worth of data

# 5.Serializers

lightweight json serializers

# 6.Compression

Enable compression on Large API Response payloads

client decompresses the data

# 7.Asynchronous Logging
