# The Stack, Heap and the Metaspace (Summary)

### Java Memory - The Rules

- All Objects are stored in Heap.
- Variables are a reference to the object
- Local Variables are stored on the stack (thread level variables)

**Stack**

- JVM Argumenr - `Xss`
- stores method invocations and local variables.
- **Each thread in a Java program has its own stack**.
- When a method is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack, which contains
  the method's parameters, local variables, and return address.
- last-in-first-out (LIFO)
- Stack memory is relatively small and fixed in size, typically around a few
  megabytes.
- Stack memory is efficient for managing method calls and local variables, but
  it's limited in size and can lead to stack overflow errors if exceeded.

**Heap**

- JVM Argumenr - `Xms Xmx`
- Stores objects and their instance variables
- The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- **shared among all threads** in a Java application.
- The heap is divided into two main regions: the young generation and the old
  generation.
    - Young generation is further divided into Eden space, and two survivor
      spaces (S0 and S1).

Objects are initially allocated in the Eden space. When Eden space fills up, **a
minor garbage collection occurs**,
and the surviving objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces.

Objects that survive several garbage collection cycles in the young generation
are eventually promoted to the old generation.

The heap is larger and more flexible than the stack, but it's also more prone to
fragmentation and garbage collection pauses.

**Metaspace**

- Metaspace, introduced in Java 8, replaces the older "permanent generation" (
  PermGen) for storing **metadata** related to classes and methods.
- Static primitives are stored in the meta space
- Static Objects are stored on the heap but object pointer/reference is held in
  the meta space
- Any object on the heap which is referenced from the meta space will never be
  garbage collected.
- All threads in Java have access to the meta space.
- It stores information such as class definitions, method information, and
  constant pool data.
- Unlike PermGen, metaspace is not part of the Java heap but is allocated from
  the native memory of the operating system.
- Metaspace automatically grows or shrinks based on the application's demand and
  the available native memory.
- The use of metaspace helps to avoid some of the limitations and issues
  associated with PermGen, such as memory leaks caused by classloader leaks.

# Stack

Every thread will have its own stack which is managed effectively by the Java
virtual machine.

Java knows exactly when data on the stack can be destroyed (
via [Automatic Garbage Collection Process](https://nitinkc.github.io/java/performance%20engineering/GarbageCollections/)

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 10;//All nums are primitive
    int value = modify(a);
}

private static int modify(int data) {
    int temp = data + 2;
    int result = temp * 2;
    return result;
}
```

The Corrosponding Stack prior to `return result`

```log
|result = 24        | 
|temp = 12          |
|data = 10          | <-- Pass By Value Example in modify(int data)
|a = 10             |
|args = empty array |
```

Stacks can only be used to store simple data types like primitives

For complex data types, Stack entry keeps a pointer to the object

```java
private Map<Integer, String>  idToNameMap;
public List<String> getAllNames() {
   int count = idToNameMap.size();
   List<String> allNames = new ArrayList<>();
   
   allNames.addAll(idToNameMap.values());
   return allNames;
}
```

The `count` variable is a primitive type allocated on the **stack**, and is
therefore
_only accessible by the thread that is currently executing_ the `getAllNames()`
method.

If 2 threads are executing the `getAllNames()` simultaneously, they have
**2 different versions of the `count`** variable on their stack.

# The Heap

Objects and their instance variables are stored in heap

The data on a stack is restricted to ONE thread and can't be accessed by other
threads in our application.

But data on the heap can be accessed by multiple threads.

* the stack is used for local primitives such as ints and doubles, but
* all objects such as Strings, Student,Customer or Integer objects will be
  stored on the heap

However, there will be a pointer to that object, which is the variable reference
and that is stored on the stack.

# Java Memory - The Rules

* Objects are stored on the heap
* Variables are reference to that object
* Local variables (primitives) are stored on the stack

Passing variables into methods in Java is always done by making a copy of the
variable.

For objects passed as a parameter into a method (let's say a List),

- the parameter value will be a copy of the list variable, which is
  a pointer to the object on the heap.

This means that a copy of the pointer to the object is created. The object
itself is not copied (into the stack) and in fact it's not the
object that's passed into the method, but rather a pointer to the object.

# The immutable classes

Behaves like primitives

The Integer.String, Double, BigDecimal classes are immutable

* its value cannot be changed once it is assigned.

Therefore, an Integer/String object is passed into a method and it is modified
it inside the method,
it actually creates a new integer object with the modified value.

# The final variables

In Java, when you declare a variable as final, it means that the reference to
the object cannot be changed once it's
initialized. However, it does not mean that the state of the object itself
cannot be modified.

# Metaspace - Since Java 8

Called PermGen prior to Java 8.

**Static primitives** are stored in the meta space

Static Objects are stored on the heap but **object pointer/reference** is held
in the meta space

Any object on the heap which is referenced from the meta space will never be
garbage collected.

All threads in Java have access to the meta space.

# Final

```java
int localVar = 10;//Primitive
List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();myList.add("Harry Potter");
Book book = new Book("Harry Potter");//Object
static int globalVariable = 90;
static Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();//Static Object
```

    subgraph Stack ["Stack"]
        myLocalVar["localVar = 10"]

    end

    subgraph Heap ["Heap"]
        ArrayList["ArrayList"]
