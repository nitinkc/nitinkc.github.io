### Higher-order functions

A common higher-order function is reduce, which is more commonly known as a
fold.
This function reduces a list to a single value.

|compose|f1.compose(f2) -> first run f2, then pass the result to f1||
|andThen|f1.andThen(f2) -> first run f1, then pass the result to f2. So,
f2.andThen(f1) is same as f1.compose(f2).||
|identity|Function.isdentity() creates a function whose apply method just
returns the argument unchanged||

Methods that Return Functions

Two common examples are filter and map.
