HTTPS transmits **encrypted** data using Transport Layer Security (TLS) while
HTTP Sends data in plane text.

# TCP Handshake:

SYN: The client sends a TCP SYN packet to the server to start the connection.

SYN-ACK: The server responds with a TCP SYN-ACK packet.

ACK: The client sends a TCP ACK packet, completing the TCP handshake and
establishing the connection.

# SSL/TLS Handshake:

##### Client Hello:

The client initiates the handshake with a "Client Hello" message containing:

- Supported SSL/TLS versions
- Supported cipher suites (encryption algorithms)
- Random number (Client Random)

##### Server Hello:

The server responds with a "Server Hello" message containing:

- Chosen SSL/TLS version
- Chosen cipher suite
- Random number (Server Random)

##### Server Certificate:

The server sends its digital certificate to the client for authentication.

- the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc

##### Server Key Exchange (if required):

The server may send additional key exchange parameters.

##### Server Hello Don

The server indicates that it has finished the initial negotiation with a "Server
Hello Done" message.

##### Client Key Exchange

The client generates a pre-master secret (a session key), encrypts it with the
server's public key (from the server's certificate),
and sends it to the server. The server receives the encrypted session key and
decrypts it with the private key.

##### Change Cipher Spec (Client):

The client sends a "Change Cipher Spec" message to indicate it will start using
the negotiated cipher suite.

##### Client Finished:

The client sends a "Client Finished" message encrypted with the new cipher
suite.

##### Change Cipher Spec (Server):

The server sends a "Change Cipher Spec" message to indicate it will start using
the negotiated cipher suite.

##### Server Finished:

The server sends a "Server Finished" message encrypted with the new cipher
suite.

##### Secure Communication:

After the handshake, both the client and server can securely communicate using
the established encryption parameters.
The TCP handshake ensures the connection is established, acknowledged, and ready
for the SSL/TLS handshake to provide secure communication.

# Why does HTTPS switch to symmetric encryption during data transmission?

1. Performance Efficiency

**Symmetric encryption is faster**: Symmetric encryption algorithms, such as
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), are
computationally less intensive than asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA.

This means they can encrypt and decrypt data much faster, making them suitable
for handling large volumes of data during an ongoing session.

**Reduced computational load:** Asymmetric encryption requires complex
mathematical operations, which can be slow and resource-intensive.
By switching to symmetric encryption after the initial handshake, HTTPS reduces
the computational load on both the client and the server,
improving overall performance and responsiveness.

It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions.

3. Security Strength

**Security:** The asymmetric encryption goes only one way.

This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the
client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key.

**Strength of symmetric encryption**: Symmetric encryption algorithms are **very
secure** when properly used,
and they offer strong encryption for data in transit. They are well-suited for
maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.

Key exchange security: During the initial SSL/TLS handshake, **asymmetric
encryption** is used to securely exchange a symmetric key (or pre-master
secret).
Once this key exchange is securely completed, both parties use the symmetric key
for the rest of the session.

This leverages the security benefits of asymmetric encryption for the key
exchange process while taking advantage of the
efficiency of symmetric encryption for data transmission.
