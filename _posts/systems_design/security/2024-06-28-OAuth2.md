OAuth stands for Open Authentication

OAuth 1.0 was designed only for the web Browsers which was enhanced to support
apps, APIs, non browser apps etc in OAuth 2.0.

- Users and Credentials are stored in a Authentication server eg. Google

Credentials are made of Scope and Claim

- Scope: Information that can be accessed
- Claim: Set of key-value pairs

User authenticates against an auth server Only ONCE

- Using the same Authentication Token all Microservices that use the same Auth
  Server can be accessed.(if its allowed)
