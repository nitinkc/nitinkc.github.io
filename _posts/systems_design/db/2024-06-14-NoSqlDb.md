NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

Data structure used : Log Structured merge tree (LSM Tree)

Relational DB uses B Tree

B-Tree is optimized for read, thus updates are relatively expensive

# Types of NoSQL Databases:
- Document-Oriented (e.g., **MongoDB**, CouchDB)
- Key-Value (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
- Column-Family (e.g., **Cassandra**, HBase)
- Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)


## MongoDB (Document-Oriented Database)
- MongoDB stores data as documents in a **BSON** format (similar to JSON).
- Itâ€™s highly scalable and flexible, ideal for applications where schema evolution is frequent.

### Aggregation Framework
MongoDB's aggregation framework allows you to perform advanced operations such 
as filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting. 

This is similar to SQL GROUP BY and JOIN operations.

##### a. Grouping Data
Use aggregation to group users by age and calculate the average age:

```java
Aggregation aggregation = Aggregation.newAggregation(
    Aggregation.group("age").avg("age").as("averageAge"),
    Aggregation.project("averageAge").and("age").previousOperation()
);

AggregationResults<AverageAge> results = mongoTemplate.aggregate(aggregation, User.class, AverageAge.class);
```

##### b. Filtering and Sorting
combine match and sort stages to filter and sort data
```java
Aggregation aggregation = Aggregation.newAggregation(
    Aggregation.match(Criteria.where("age").gt(20)),
    Aggregation.sort(Sort.by(Sort.Order.asc("name"))),
    Aggregation.limit(10)
);

List<User> users = mongoTemplate.aggregate(aggregation, User.class, User.class).getMappedResults();
```

### Embedded Documents
use embedded documents for denormalized models.
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private Address address; // Embedded document
}
```


## Redis (Key-Value Store)
Redis is an in-memory key-value store, known for its speed and simplicity.
Ideal for caching, session management, and real-time data scenarios.
