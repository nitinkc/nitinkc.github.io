# Skip List

# Hash index:

a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)

# SSTable - Sorted String Tables

(https://nitinkc.github.io/system%20design/SSTables/)[https://nitinkc.github.io/system%20design/SSTables/]

# LSM tree: Skiplist + SSTable

[https://nitinkc.github.io/system%20design/LSM-Tree/](https://nitinkc.github.io/system%20design/LSM-Tree/)

# B-tree:

disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance

# Inverted index:

used for document indexing. Used in Lucene

# Suffix tree:

for string pattern search

# R-tree:

multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor
