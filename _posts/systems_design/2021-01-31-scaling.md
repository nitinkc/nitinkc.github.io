| **HORIZONTAL**                 | **VERTICAL**            | 
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Load balancing Required        | NA                      |
| Resilient                      | Single point of failure |
| RPC (Slow Network Calls)       | IPC - fast calls        |
| Data inconsistency             | Consistent              |
| Scales well as users increases | Hardware limit          |
