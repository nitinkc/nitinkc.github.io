title: Scaling Vertical vs Horizontal
---

- Vertical Scaling(Scaling Up) - Buying a bigger machine
- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out) - Adding more machines

| **HORIZONTAL**                 | **VERTICAL**            | 
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Load balancing Required        | NA                      |
| Resilient                      | Single point of failure |
| RPC (Slow Network Calls)       | IPC - fast calls        |
| Data inconsistency             | Consistent              |
| Scales well as users increases | Hardware limit          |

- Horizontal Scaling of DB is known as Sharding

Exposing the code/algorithm sitting on server via an API through a
protocol

Sending the response back to the user
