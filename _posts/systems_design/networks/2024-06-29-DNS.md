Browser asks DNS resolver for the IP address. It could be

- ISP
- Service like CloudFlare 1.1.1.
- Google 8.8.8.8

If DNS resolver does not have the IP address in its cache, it asks the
respective Authoritative nameservers

How does DNS resolver finds the authoritative name server?

3 levels of Authoritative name servers

- Root nameservers
- Top Level Domain (TLD) NameServer
- Authoritative nameservers
