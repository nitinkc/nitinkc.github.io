Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a decentralized network architecture where each
participant (peer) can act as both a client and a server. Here are the key
points:

# Key Characteristics

**Decentralization**: There is no central server. Each peer is equally
privileged and can initiate or complete any task.

**Scalability**: P2P networks can easily scale as more peers join the network.

**Fault Tolerance**: Since there is no single point of failure, the network is
more resilient. If one peer fails, others can continue to operate.

# How P2P Works

Discovery: Peers find each other through various methods, such as a central
directory or using distributed hash tables (DHTs).

Handshake: Peers establish a connection by exchanging information about the
protocols and data formats they support.

Data Exchange: Peers can directly share files or data with each other.

# Protocols

BitTorrent: Used for efficient file sharing. Files are broken into small pieces,
and peers download pieces from each other.

Gnutella: A decentralized file-sharing protocol where peers query each other to
find files.

Kademlia (DHT): A protocol for storing and retrieving key-value pairs in a
decentralized manner.

Bitcoin/Ethereum (Blockchain): Cryptocurrencies use P2P networks to maintain a
distributed ledger of transactions.

# Use Cases

File Sharing: Sharing large files (e.g., movies, software). Examples:
BitTorrent.

Content Distribution: Distributing content efficiently by leveraging multiple
peers. Examples: Some streaming services.

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum use P2P networks for secure and
decentralized transaction processing.

VoIP: Voice and video calls over P2P networks. Examples: Skype.

Decentralized Applications (dApps): Applications that run on blockchain
networks, providing greater security and resilience.

Imagine a 5 GB file to be distributed to 1K nodes. with 40Gbps (5GBps -
GigaBytes per second) network (throughput for a good data center)

- it will take a second to transfer the file from one one node to the other.
  Thus 1000 seconds for the transfer.

With peer-to-peer networks,

- divide the 5GB files into a 1000 pieces of 1MB Each and let the peers transfer
  simultaneously

## Tracker:

A **tracker** is a centralized server that acts as a directory for peers
participating in a P2P network, typically associated with BitTorrent and similar
file-sharing protocols.

**Functionality**:

- **Peer Registration**: Peers connect to the tracker to register themselves and
  announce the files they have available for sharing.
- **Peer Discovery**: Other peers looking for specific files query the tracker
  to get a list of peers currently sharing those files.
- **Coordination**: The tracker helps coordinate connections between peers,
  facilitating the establishment of direct peer-to-peer connections for file
  sharing.

Trackers are centralized points of control in the network, meaning that their
availability and
performance can impact the overall usability of the P2P system.

## Distributed Hash Table (DHT):

A **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** is a decentralized method for storing and
retrieving
key-value pairs across a distributed network of nodes (peers).

**Functionality**:

- **Decentralization**: Each peer in the network maintains a portion of the DHT,
  contributing to the storage and retrieval of data.
- **Key-Value Storage**: Data (e.g., information about files, peer locations) is
  stored in the DHT using a distributed hash function, which determines where in
  the network each piece of data is stored.
- **Lookup**: Peers can query the DHT to find the location of specific data (
  e.g., which peers have a particular file).

DHTs are resilient to node failures and can scale effectively with the size of
the network.
They do not rely on a single point of failure or control.

BitTorrent also supports DHTs (using a protocol known as Mainline DHT) as an
alternative to trackers for peer discovery and swarm management, enhancing
robustness and decentralization.
