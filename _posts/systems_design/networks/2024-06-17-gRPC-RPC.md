gRPC : good for **interprocess communication** not good for client server

# RPC - Remote Procedure Call

A protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located
on another computer
in a network without needing to understand network details.

It allows **a local function call** to execute on a **remote server** as if it
were a local call, **simplifying** the process of building distributed systems

# Key Concepts

**Client**: The component that initiates the call to a remote service.

**Server**: The component that provides the service and handles the remote
calls.

**Stub**: An intermediary that represents the remote service on the client side.
It handles the communication with the actual remote service.

**Skeleton**: An intermediary on the server side that handles the incoming
request, processes it, and sends back the response.

## Steps in RPC Communication

**Client Call**: The client makes a local call to the stub.

**Marshalling**: The stub packages (marshals) the request data and sends it over
the network to the server.

**Server Handling**: The skeleton on the server side unpacks (unmarshals) the
request and calls the actual service.

**Execution**: The service performs the requested operation.

**Response**: The result is sent back to the skeleton.

**Unmarshalling**: The skeleton packages (marshals) the response and sends it
back to the client stub.

**Client Receives**: The stub on the client side unpacks (unmarshals) the
response and presents it as the result of the local call.

# gRPC - gRPC Remote Procedure Call

[https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-grpc-work](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-grpc-work)

gRPC, which stands for gRPC Remote Procedure Call, high-performance framework
developed by Google.

- designed for efficient communication between microservices, allowing functions
  to be called remotely just as they would locally.
- gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobufs) as the interface
  description language.
- The client perceives the interaction as a simple local function call, even
  though it involves complex network operations.

## Key Concepts of gRPC

**Service Definition**: Defined using Protocol Buffers, a language-neutral,
platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

**Client**: The component that makes the call to the remote service.

**Server**: The component that implements the service and handles the remote
calls.

**Stub**: The client-side proxy generated from the service definition that
handles the communication with the server.

**Skeleton**: The server-side proxy generated from the service definition that
receives the request and forwards it to the actual implementation.

### Steps in gRPC Communication

**Service Definition**: Define the service and message types using Protocol
Buffers (.proto file).

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

**Code Generation**: Generate client and server code using the Protocol Buffers
compiler (protoc).

```sh
protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. helloworld.proto
```

**Local gRPC Call/Client Call**: The client calls a method on the stub. e.g.,
`stub.SayHello(request)`

**Marshalling**: The stub marshals the request data using Protocol Buffers and
sends it over HTTP/2.

**Server Handling**: The server skeleton unmarshals the request and invokes the
actual service method.

**Execution**: The service method executes and returns a response.

**Response**: The response is marshaled by the server skeleton, sent back over
HTTP/2, unmarshaled by the client stub, and returned to the client.
