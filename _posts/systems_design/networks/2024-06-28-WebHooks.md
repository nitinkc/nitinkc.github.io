Webhooks are a powerful way to enable real-time communication between systems.

They allow one system to **send automated notifications** or **data updates**
to another system when certain **events** occur, without the need for the 
receiving system to continually check (constant polling) for updates.

Also known as **reverse APIs** or **push APIs** because the _**server sends HTTP requests
to the client**_

- Custom HTTP Callbacks triggered by specific events
- eliminated the need of polling

Pay attention to 3 things when using a webhook:

- design a proper API for the external service to call.
- set up proper rules in the API gateway for security reasons.
- register the correct URL at the external service.

## WebHooks in payment Services

The payment service -> external payment service provider (PSP)

1. Short polling

- keeps asking the PSP about the payment status.

**Drawbacks**

- Constant polling requires resources from the payment service.
- The External service communicates directly with the payment service, creating
  security vulnerabilities.


2. Webhook

Register a webhook with the external service.

- calls back at a certain URL when there is an updates on the request.
- the PSP invoke the HTTP request to update the payment status (upon successful
  completion).
- if the PSP never calls back, then a fallback polling mechanism can be used
