Step 1 - The client sends an HTTP request to the API gateway.

Step 2 - The API gateway parses and **validates the attributes** in the HTTP
request.

Step 3 - The API gateway performs allow-list/deny-list checks.

Step 4 - The API gateway talks to an identity provider for authentication and
authorization.

Step 5 - The rate limiting rules are applied to the request. If it is over the
limit, the request is rejected.

Steps 6 and 7 - Now that the request has passed basic checks, the API gateway
finds the relevant service to route to by path matching.

Step 8 - The API gateway transforms the request into the appropriate protocol
and sends it to backend microservices.

Steps 9-12: The API gateway can handle errors properly, and deals with faults if
the error takes a longer time to recover (circuit break). It can also leverage
ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stack for logging and monitoring. We sometimes
cache data in the API gateway.
