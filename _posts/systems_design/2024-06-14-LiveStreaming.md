video content delivery from streamer's computer to the viewer's device (
glass-to-glass latency)

Video processing is compute-intensive

Video Capture -> Encoders (OBS, Webcam Capture, phone camera)

Real-time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)
- TCP-based protocol

Secured Reliable transport - could replace RTMP

- UDP based
- promises lower latency
- better resilience to poor network conditions.

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)

# Videos on CDN's

How are they protected?

**Token-based authentication**:
The CDN server sends each user request to the main server to authenticate
whether the user can view the video.

- If authorized, the CDN serves the video.
- provides strong authentication but is slower (trade-off) and less secure since
  the CDN can access and misuse the user's token.

**Domain-based authentication**: The CDN server restricts video access based on
the domain from which the request originates.

- If the request comes from an allowed domain, the CDN serves the video;
  otherwise, access is denied.
- This approach is simple and fast but vulnerable to domain spoofing and lacks
  user-specific authorization.

**Server-side authentication**: The user's request directly communicates with
the server for authentication.

- The server generates a token signed by the user's private key, indicating
  permission to access the video.
- This token is then forwarded to the CDN, which verifies its authenticity using
  the public key and grants access accordingly.
- The token can have a TTL to mitigate unauthorized sharing.
- mix of security and efficiency.

Digital rights management (DRM) solutions can be used to prevent unauthorized
copying or multiple IP addresses accessing the content.
