Temporary storage that stores a part of the DB

- reduces the response time
- reduces the load on the database

### Global Cache vs Local Cache

**Local Cache**

- in-memory
- no need for any network calls for the cache storage if its in RAM

**Global Cache**

- Redis or Memcached
- Redis as a Global Data cache.
- Can be scaled independently

Cache Eviction and Loading Policy

[https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101?tab=readme-ov-file#top-caching-strategies](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101?tab=readme-ov-file#top-caching-strategies)

# Write Policies in a cache

A write request means some entry is `added, updated or deleted` in the cache

Write policy is when there is a write operation in a cache, usually a user
operation

- Create
- Delete
- Update

Write back

- timeout based persistence
- Cache is always updated
- DB is eventually consistent

[https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/](https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/)

### Write-Back Policy

- If the key-value pair to be updated, is present in the cache then it is
  updated.
    - the key-value pair is not immediately updated in the database.

**Timeout-Based Persistence**. In this mechanism, we have a TTL(Time to Live for
each entry in cache).
If the timestamp becomes greater than the TTL, the entry is evicted and the data
is persisted in the database.

This makes the database eventually consistent

**Event-Based Write Back**. In this mechanism, keep an event-based trigger along
with Key-Value Pair.
For example, # of updates as a trigger, if it becomes greater than 5 -> triggers
to persist cache value in the database

**Replacement Write Back**. For each entry in the cache, we have an attribute
that tells us if the entry is updated or not.
When we want to evict the entry we update the entry in the database if the entry
was updated in the cache

### Write-Through Policy

when there is a write request, we evict the key that is being updated, while
simultaneously updating the database.

The next time there is a read request, the cache polls the database and receives
the response.

- lock the data which is to be written and only unlock the data after the update
  operation is completed.
- provides a high level of consistency
- and a high level of persistence
- Less efficient compared to the write-back policy

### Write-Around Policy

instead of updating the entry in the cache, we update the entry in the database.

Now when we get a read request,
we will send the stale value from the cache.

And we will be getting stale value until the entry is evicted from the cach

# Cache Eviction Policies

Policies to Evict the data from the cache.

A replacement policy is triggered when there is no space for a new key and a key
is evicted from the cache
Replacement policy is when a new entry is copied from the DB

### LRU - Least Recently Used

evict the entry that has not been used for the **longest**

### LFU Policy (Least Frequently Used)

evict the entry that is used the least number of times (frequency)

Add a frequency data point and determine which pair is to be evicted

In most cases,**_LRU Policy works better than LFU_**

# Thrashing

- When the miss ratio is high and there are a lot of loads and evictions
- Cache never has required data and DB is asked everytime

# Replacement Policy in Memcached

Mem-cached has three regions-cold, warm and hot.The hot region does not contain
the Last Used timestamp.

As new entries come in,entries in the hot region are pushed to the warm or cold
region

One data store is used to store entries that are less requested (cold region)
Another data store is used to store entries that are more requested (warm
region)

Entries gets promoted based on the usage from Cold to Warm regions

whether the entry lives in the hot or cold region is decided by the frequency of
usage.
And whether the entry needs to be evicted is decided by its LastUsed timestamp

This process is known as Segmented LRU.

# Caching Pitfalls

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh98s0XhMmQ)

# Cache Eviction, Cache Policies, and Cache Expiry Policy

## Cache Eviction

Cache eviction refers to the process of removing items from a cache to make
space for new data. It is necessary when the cache reaches its capacity limit
and needs to discard older or less frequently accessed items to accommodate new
entries.

### Reasons for Cache Eviction

- **Capacity Limit**: When the cache is full and cannot store additional data.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Following cache replacement policies to manage data
  efficiently.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that cache access times remain fast by
  removing less useful or outdated entries.

## Cache Policies

Cache policies determine how items are selected for eviction when the cache
reaches its capacity limit. Various strategies are employed to maximize cache
hit rates and minimize cache misses.

### Common Cache Replacement Policies

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts the least recently accessed items first.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts the least frequently accessed items
  first.
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Evicts the oldest items first, regardless of
  access patterns.
- **MRU (Most Recently Used)**: Evicts the most recently accessed items first.
- **Random Replacement**: Selects a random item for eviction.
- **Write-Around**: Data is written directly to the storage but not cached until
  read requests for that data occur.
- **Write-Through**: Data is written to both the cache and the underlying
  storage on write operations.
- **Read-Through**: Data is initially read from the cache. If not present, it is
  fetched from the underlying storage and then cached.

### Choosing a Cache Policy

- **Performance Considerations**: Different policies perform better depending on
  access patterns (e.g., LRU for temporal locality).
- **Implementation Complexity**: Some policies are simpler to implement but may
  not perform optimally in all scenarios.
- **Application Requirements**: Align the policy with application-specific
  requirements for cache behavior.

## Cache Expiry Policy

Cache expiry policy determines when cached items become invalid and should be
removed from the cache. It helps maintain data freshness and consistency between
the cached data and the source of truth.

### Strategies for Cache Expiry

- **Time-Based Expiry**: Set an expiration time for each cached item. Items are
  automatically evicted when they expire.
- **Event-Based Expiry**: Invalidate items based on external events or changes
  in the source data.
- **Lazy Expiry**: Remove items from the cache only when they are accessed and
  determined to be expired (on-demand expiration).

### Implementation Considerations

- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Specifies how long an item can remain in the cache
  before it expires.
- **Synchronization**: Ensure that cache expiry is synchronized with updates to
  the source data to prevent stale cache entries.
- **Notification Mechanisms**: Use callbacks or event listeners to handle cache
  expiry events efficiently.

Cache eviction, cache policies, and cache expiry policies are crucial for
optimizing cache performance, managing memory efficiently, and ensuring that
cached data remains accurate and up-to-date with minimal overhead.
