Tim Burgland - Distributed Systems in one Lecture

Distributed Systems is a collection of independent computers that appear to its
users as one computer.

- Computers that operate concurrently
- computers can fail independently
- computers do-not share global clock.
    - Asynchronous with respect to other machine.
