Measure of how **up-to-date* a piece of data is in a distributed systems with
geographically distributed nodes.

**Consistency Levels**

### Linearizable/Serializable Consistency

- EveryRead operation results in the **MOST up-to-date** data
- To achieve this a single-threaded single server may be used.So every read and
  write request will always be ordered
- Every request is processed linearly one by one
    - Others wait while one request gets processed
    - If the processing request fails or takes a long time or sleeps, every
      other request has to wait (**Head-of-line Blocking**)
    - Single point of failure
    - High Latency - Time taken to process the request successfully.
    - Low Availability - Chance of a system to be able to respond to a request
    - High Consistency -

### Eventual Consistency

- we can send stale data for a read request,but eventually,return the latest
  data after updates are done
- Until we are returning the stale data our system is not consideredconsistent
  but we can guarantee that after some time it will be consistent
- To achieve this we can process read and write requests parallelly (using
  multiple servers) or concurrently (using multiple threads)
- Multiple servers can send requests to a DB at the same time
    - If `WRITE (then)-> READ` is expected and both requests went from 2
      different instances of a service,
        - may be possible that Read goes in first and reads the data before
          writing it
- Same with email - if the mail is in the outbox, eventually it will be sent

### Causal Consistency

- if a previous operation is related to the current operation then the previous
  operation has to be executed before the current operation
- Extracts the requests based on the keys and order sequentially and perform
  operation
- Causal consistency is stronger and slower than eventual consistency because
  operations for the same key are processed sequentially.
- **Fails on Aggregation**
    - causal consistency orders query based on IDs but aggregation operations
      use all IDs

### Quorum

- At this consistency level, we have multiple replicas of the database and these
  replicas may or may not be in sync.
- For a read query, we get the data from all the replicas and return the
  mostappropriate values (Majority value, Latest updated value etc).
- It works on some kind of consensus in the distributed system.
- Eventually consistent
- Distributed Consensus
- It provides fault tolerance and depending upon the values R, W and N we can
  either have an
    - eventually consistent system (R + W <= N) or
    - a strongly consistent system (R + W > N)

A system can be strongly consistent by specifying the **minimum number of
replicas**
it needs to read the data from.

R + W > N where,

- R = Minimum Number of replicas to read the data from
- W = Number of replicas data is written to
- N = Total Number of replicas

| Consistency Level         | Consistency                          | Efficiency                           |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Linearizable/Serializable | Highest                              | Lowest                               |
| Causal Consistency        | Linealizable > **Causal** > Eventual | Linealizable < **Causal** < Eventual |
| Quorun                    | Configurable                         | Configurable                         |
| Eventual Consistency      | Lowest                               | Highest                              |
