### Hard Drives

* HDD - 100 MBps
* SSD - 500 MBps
* Memory Card - 1GBps

### Networks

* 4G/LTE - 30MBps to 100MBPS
* LAN - 1 GBPS
* 5G - to be introduced
* 40Gbps (5GBps - GigaBytes per second) - network throughput for a good data
  center
    - if i have a file of 5GB, it will take a second to transfer the file from
      one one node to the other

Assume a good quality image of 1 MB

* Thumbnail is 1/10th of the actual image -> 100 KB

| Write 1MB into the disk            |               | 2 times than Read approximately (for HDD), for SSD, 1.2 times |
| Read 1MB sequentially from Memory  | 300μs (250μs) | 1 lakh times faster than disk                                 |

| Compress 1MB using Zippy           | 10ms          | for 1KB, $$ \frac{10 * 10^{-3}}{10^{-3}} = 10μs $$            |

* Compress data before sending over internet

# QPS - Queries per second

Peak QPS = 2 to 5 times QPS

### Time Estimations

1 Day has $ \textrm{86400 seconds} = 24\times 60\times 60 \approx 90K secs $

100 Million load per day

$ \text{Load per second} = \frac{100 \times 10^6}{90 \times 10^3} = \frac{100{,}000{,}000}{90{,}000} = 1111.11\overline{1} \approx 1200 $

Denominator is slightly increased to 90K so for lesser denominator the output
will increase

# Estimates

1. DAU : Daily Average Users eg. 300 million MAU
2. Usage per DAU = 10 -25% make a post  (QPS : Queries per second)
3. Scale Factor : estimate how much higher the traffic would peak, compared to
   the average

### Latency Numbers :

Billion is $ 10^9 $
nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second

Million is $ 10^6 $
microsecond is 1 millionth of a second
