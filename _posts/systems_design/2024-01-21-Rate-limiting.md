Can be in an application server or a DB server or any type od servers

Overloaded systems can

- increase latency
- OOM errors
- results in cascading failures (when one fails, all requests are transferred to
  another overloading the other one)

**Rate Limiting Algorithms**

# Sliding Window Rate Limiting

Allow only a certain number of requests in a time interval. Additional requests
are dropped

- Simple to implement

Issues

- Memory footprint

If sliding window is of size N, keep N requests in the memory.

- Garbage collection

finding the requests to evict needs N searches each time

# Timer Wheel Algorithm

The timer wheel allots requests to slots based on the time of their arrival.

- Size of the wheel (Number of buckets) = Timeout of the incoming request
- Bucket is numbered 0 to Timeout -1
- Each bucket can store a limited number of requests (In a Linked List or a
  Queue)
- Request is added into the bucket number = **Time % Number of buckets/Size of
  Wheel**, Modulo operator keeps it revolving
    - System can pull requests from this queue one by one.
- Before inserting a new request into a bucket it deletes all the existing
  requests (These requests have not been processed by the system)

### Hierarchal Timer Wheel

# Rate Limiting Internal Requests

Ways to identify the request overloading within the system

- Average response time : if its increasing, then the system is overloaded
- Age of meggases in the wait Queue : If the Queue is slowly processed, the
  average age of the request in the queue will be increasing
- Increased number of requests in the Dead Letter Queue
