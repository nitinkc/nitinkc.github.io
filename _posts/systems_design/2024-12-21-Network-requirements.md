# 1. **Request Size**
- **API Request Size**:
  - **10KB - 100KB per request** (depends on the type of data, media, and request complexity).
  - For **text-based APIs** (e.g., JSON), requests might be smaller (10-50 KB).
  - For **media-heavy requests** (e.g., image uploads/downloads), requests can be larger (100KB - 1MB+).
- **Example**:
  - **Text-based API**: 20 KB per request.
  - **Image Upload**: 200 KB per image.
  - **Video Upload**: 5MB - 50MB per video file.

# 2. **Traffic Volume**
- **API Calls per Day**:
  - **DAU of 1M users** with **50 API calls per user per day** = **50M API calls/day**.
- **Data Transferred per Day**:
  - **For text-based requests**: If each API request is 20 KB, then:
    - 50M requests/day * 20 KB = **1 TB/day** of network traffic.
  - **For media requests**: If each upload is 200 KB (e.g., images), and users upload **10 images per day**:
    - 1M users * 10 images/day * 200 KB = **2 TB/day** of upload traffic.
  - **Example**: For an app with **1M DAUs**, each uploading **10 images** of **200 KB** per day, youâ€™d have **2 TB/day** of image upload traffic.

# 3. **Data Transfer per User**
- **Non-Media Apps**:
  - Text-based APIs: **10KB - 50KB per user/day**.
  - For **1M DAUs**, this would be **10-50 GB/day**.
- **Media-Heavy Apps**:
  - Images: **100KB - 1MB per user/day**.
  - Videos: **10MB - 100MB per user/day**.
  - For **1M DAUs**, the total could be several **GB - TB per day**.

# 4. **Peak Traffic**
- **Peak Load**: Network traffic can spike during certain periods (e.g., during specific events or promotions).
- **Peak Factor**: Multiply by a **2x-3x factor** for peak traffic estimates.
  - **Example**: For an average of **1 TB/day**, expect peak usage to be around **2-3 TB/day**.
  - Peak usage could also mean bursts of high request rates (e.g., **100K requests per second** during high traffic events).

# 5. **Latency and Bandwidth Requirements**
- **Latency**: Define how quickly your system needs to respond. Common latency targets are:
  - **Low Latency** (e.g., 100ms-200ms) for real-time apps like chat or gaming.
  - **Higher Latency** (e.g., 500ms-1s) for non-real-time apps (e.g., video streaming).
- **Bandwidth**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth to handle peak traffic.
  - **Example**: If an app with **50M API calls/day** transfers **1 TB/day** of data, then the average bandwidth required will be:
    - **1 TB/day = 1,000 GB/day = 41.67 GB/hour**.
    - If requests are distributed evenly across 24 hours, the required bandwidth would be approximately **11.5 MB/s**.

# 6. **Network Resilience**
- **Redundancy**: Use multiple network paths and providers to ensure reliability.
  - Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for static content (images, videos) to offload traffic and reduce latency.
- **Example**:
  - **Static Content** (e.g., images) could be served via a CDN, reducing the load on your primary server by **30%-70%**.

# 7. **Content Delivery (CDN) Usage**
- **CDN for Media-heavy Apps**:
  - Offload **images, videos, static assets** to CDNs to reduce latency and improve speed.
  - **Example**: For an app with **10M DAUs**, where each user downloads **1MB of images per day**, using a CDN could reduce bandwidth requirements by serving cached content closer to users.
- **CDN Benefits**:
  - Reduces the load on your primary servers and network.
  - Improves performance for users globally by serving content from the nearest location.

# 8. **Burst Traffic Handling**
- **Handling Bursts**: Estimate how your system will handle sudden surges in traffic.
  - Use **load balancers** and **auto-scaling** to handle unexpected increases in load.
  - Consider strategies like **rate-limiting** and **request queues** to manage traffic spikes gracefully.
- **Example**: During a flash sale or major event, network traffic could temporarily increase by **3x-5x**.

# 9. **Network Costs**
- **Cloud Providers**: Bandwidth costs vary depending on the cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).
  - Egress traffic (data leaving the data center) is typically more expensive than ingress traffic.
- **Cost Consideration**:
  - Estimate costs based on the expected data transfer (e.g., if you expect **2 TB/day** of data transfer, calculate the cost of this bandwidth with your cloud provider).

# General Tips for Network Requirements Estimation
- **Use Average and Peak Traffic Assumptions**: Always account for both average and peak traffic when estimating network requirements.
- **Factor in Media Usage**: Media-heavy apps (e.g., social platforms, streaming services) will consume significantly more bandwidth.
- **Consider CDNs**: For media and static assets, CDNs can reduce the load on your primary infrastructure and improve performance.
- **Plan for Growth**: Expect network traffic to grow with the user base, so plan for scalability.
- **Bandwidth Calculation**: Ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle peak loads, with some buffer for unexpected traffic surges.
