{: .notice--primary}

**Latency** -> 1ms (speed of transfer)
- refers to the time it takes for a single unit of data to travel from its source to its destination.
- It measures the delay or the time it takes for data to traverse a system.
- Typically measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (μs).

**Throughput** -> quantity of transfer (bps,tps)
- Throughput refers to the rate at which data is transferred, processed, or handled by a system within a given period of time. 
- It measures the quantity of data being transferred or processed over time.
- measured in bits per second (bps), packets per second (pps), or transactions per second (TPS)

# HTTP Status Codes
- HTTP 401 -> Invalid
- Http 429 -> Too Many Requests (used in Rate limiting algo)
- Http 301 -> Redirect (Moved Permanently, stores in cache, less server load)
  - Clients should update their bookmarks.
- HTTP 302 -> Found (Temporary Redirect) - Redirect (used to track click rates) 
  - The resource requested is temporarily under a different URL. The client should use the original URL for future requests.
- HTTP 503 -> Service Unavailable
- HTTP 101 -> Changed Protocol (used in WebSockets)
  - The server is switching protocols as requested by the client. This is often used to switch to WebSocket protocol.

# Distributed Databases
Problems with Distributed Databases Running in Multiple Nodes

#### 1. Problems with Writing Data
**Network Latency**:
- **Solution**: Optimize network protocols, use efficient data serialization formats, and place nodes in close-proximity to reduce latency.
 
**Write Conflicts**:
- **Solution**: Implement conflict resolution strategies such as last-write-wins, version vectors, or application-specific logic.

**Replication Lag**:
- **Solution**: Use faster replication mechanisms like asynchronous replication and ensure adequate network bandwidth.
 
**Partitioning and Sharding**:
- **Solution**: Use consistent hashing for efficient data distribution and rebalancing mechanisms to handle dynamic changes in data.

#### 2. Problems with Reading Data
**Data Consistency**:
- **Solution**: Choose the appropriate consistency model (e.g., linearizability, strong consistency, eventual consistency, causal consistency) based on the application needs and use quorum reads.
  - use protocols like Paxos or Raft for strong consistency

**Stale Data**:
- **Solution**: Implement mechanisms like read-repair, anti-entropy protocols, and tune replication factors to reduce staleness.

**Load Balancing**:
**Solution**: Use advanced load balancing techniques such as consistent hashing, random sampling, and dynamic load adjustment.

**Partition Tolerance**:
- **Solution**: Design the system to degrade gracefully during partitions and use techniques like eventual consistency to ensure data convergence.

#### 3. Maintaining Consistency and Availability
- **Quorum Consensus**:
  - **Solution**: Adjust quorum sizes dynamically based on system state and use techniques like read/write quorums to balance consistency and availability.
- **Data Recovery and Fault Tolerance**:
  - **Solution**: Use replication, backups, and consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) to ensure data is recoverable and the system is resilient to failures.
- **Coordination and Synchronization**:
  - **Solution**: Use coordination services (e.g., Zookeeper, etcd) for distributed locks and leader election, and design algorithms to minimize the need for coordination.


- **Consensus-Based Distributed Databases**: Ensure consistency across distributed nodes.
  - Examples: **YugabyteDB**, **CockroachDB**
- Keep copies of data (master-slave design)

## Data Center and Transaction Processing
- **Typical Data Center Node**: Can support a few thousand transactions per second.
- **ZooKeeper**: Used to maintain sharding information in distributed databases.

# Data Synchronization
- **Anti-Entropy Protocol**: Nodes compare and reconcile their data to ensure consistency.
  - **Merkle Trees**: Used to detect inconsistencies efficiently.

### Handling Race Conditions in Distributed Environments
- Multiple nodes trying to update the same resource simultaneously.
- Concurrent transactions in a distributed database leading to inconsistent states.

**Prevention Techniques**:
- **Locks and Semaphores**: Ensure only one process can access a resource at a time.
- **Transactional Systems**: Use of ACID transactions to ensure consistency.
- **Versioning and Vector Clocks**: Track changes and resolve conflicts based on causality.
- **Idempotent Operations**: Design operations to be repeatable without causing different outcomes.

##### Inconsistency Resolution (Caused due to data replication)

- **Vector Clocks**: Track causality and versioning to resolve inconsistencies caused by concurrent updates.

**Tools**:
- **Zookeeper**: For coordination and distributed locking.
- **Etcd**: A distributed key-value store that provides coordination and consistency guarantees.

## Transaction Coordination (in distributed Env)

### Problems with Distributed Transactions

#### 1. Network Latency
Distributed transactions often involve communication across different nodes, which can introduce significant network latency.

**Solution**:
- Optimize network protocols.
- Minimize data transfer.
- Use batching and parallelism.

#### 2. Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Limitations
The 2PC protocol is commonly used to **ensure atomicity** in distributed transactions but can lead to bottlenecks and is vulnerable to coordinator failures.

**Solution**:
- Use Three-Phase Commit (3PC).
- Employ consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) - for greater fault tolerance

#### 3. Resource Locking
Distributed transactions can lock resources across multiple nodes, leading to contention and reduced system throughput.

**Solution**:
- Implement distributed locking mechanisms.
- Use timeout-based locks.
- Consider lock-free or optimistic concurrency control.

#### 4. Data Consistency
Ensuring consistency across distributed nodes is challenging, especially in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

**Solution**:
- Use appropriate consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency).
- Employ conflict resolution strategies.
 
#### 5. Failure Handling
Handling failures (node crashes, network partitions) in distributed transactions is complex and can lead to data inconsistency or transaction rollback issues.

**Solution**:
- Implement robust failure detection and recovery mechanisms.
- Use transaction logs for recovery.
- Design for graceful handling of partial failures.

#### 6. Scalability
As the number of nodes increases, coordinating transactions across them becomes more complex and can impact performance.

**Solution**:
  - Design with scalability in mind.
  - Use sharding and partitioning.
  - Minimize cross-node transactions.

#### 7. Distributed Deadlocks
Distributed transactions can lead to deadlocks where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources.

**Solution**:
- Implement deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms.
- Use timeout-based deadlock prevention.
- Consider deadlock-free protocols.


### 2-Phase Commit (2PC)
Either all nodes commit the transaction or all of them abort.

**Phase 1 (Prepare)**: 
- The coordinator sends a `prepare` request to all participants. 
- Participants execute the transaction up to the point of committing and vote to either commit or abort. 
- Each participant writes the transaction to a log.

**Phase 2 (Commit)**: 
- If all participants vote to commit, the coordinator sends a `commit` request. 
- If any participant votes to abort, the coordinator sends an `abort` request.

**Use Cases**: Suitable for short-lived transactions requiring strong consistency.

### Try-Confirm/Cancel (TCC)
A three-phase protocol used to achieve distributed transaction management with compensating actions. 

- **Try**: Reserve resources required for the transaction. Ensure that all preconditions are met.
- **Confirm**: Once all `Try` operations succeed, actually execute the transaction.
- **Cancel**: If any `Try` operation fails, roll back all reserved resources.

**Use Cases**: Suitable for business transactions that require reservation of resources and eventual consistency.

### Saga Pattern
A sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates the database and **publishes an event** or message triggering the next transaction step. 
- If a transaction fails, the saga executes compensating transactions to undo the impact of the preceding transactions.

**Choreography**: Each service listens for events and decides if an action is needed. There is no central coordination.

**Orchestration**: A central coordinator tells each participant what local transaction to execute.

**Use Cases**: Long-lived transactions where each step is independently recoverable and eventual consistency is acceptable.
