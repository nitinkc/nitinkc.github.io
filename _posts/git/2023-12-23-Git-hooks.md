- all the hooks are present by default with `.sample` file extension in
  `.git/hooks`
- remove the file extension
- execute this command to make it executable

```shell
touch pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
```

# pre commit

[https://github.com/nitinkc/SystemEnvironment/blob/master/gitHooks/pre-commit](https://github.com/nitinkc/SystemEnvironment/blob/master/gitHooks/pre-commit)

**Prevent commits to special branches**

```shell
PROTECTED_BRANCHES="^(master|develop|release-*|bugfix-*)"
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ ($SPECIAL_BRANCH) ]]; then
  echo >&2 "Preventing commit on $CURRENT_BRANCH branch"
  echo >&2 "commit with -n switch to bypass the pre-commit hook."
  echo >&2 "Hooks at Repo would prevent push directly to such branch"
  exit 1
```

### `-n` to bypass the hook

```shell
 git commit -n -m "final commit"
```

Allow creation of a new branch if attempted to commit to a restricted branch

```shell
# Get the current branch name
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
# List of branches where commits are restricted
restricted_branches=("main" "develop" "bugfix")

# Check if the current branch is restricted
if [[ " ${restricted_branches[@]} " =~ " ${current_branch} " ]]; then
    echo "Error: Commits to branch '${current_branch}' are not allowed."
    echo "Using git switch -c new-branch-name to switch to a new branch"
    
    # Generate a unique branch name with current date and timestamp
    new_branch_name="feature/new_branch_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')"
    echo " switching to the new branch $new_branch_name" 
    git switch -c $new_branch_name
    
    exit 1
fi
```

# pre-push

```shell
#!/bin/bash

AUTHORINFO=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT) || exit 1
NAME=$(printf '%s\n' "${AUTHORINFO}" | sed -n 's/^\(.*\) <.*$/\1/p')
EMAIL=$(printf '%s\n' "${AUTHORINFO}" | sed -n 's/^.* <\(.*\)> .*$/\1/p')

echo "Name and email for this commit: ${NAME}<${EMAIL}>"
if [ "${EMAIL}" =~ "abc@gmail.com" ]; then
  echo >&2 "Please commit using Enterprise ID instead of personal name ${NAME} and email <${EMAIL}>":
  exit 1;
fi
exit 0
```

# Global githooks

Set up at machine level; to be applied for each project

## Standardizing Hooks

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.git-templates/hooks
#Create a pre commit hook file and set its permissions
touch ~/.git-templates/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ~/.git-templates/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Configure Git to Use the Global Hooks Directory:

This setting ensures that the hooks from `~/.git-templates/hooks` are copied to
the `.git/hooks` directory in every **new repository** you create.

```shell
git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git-templates'
```

### For Existing Repositories:

Need to manually copy the hooks from the global directory into each repository's
`.git/hooks` directory.

```shell
for repo in $(find /path/to/your/repos -type d -name '.git'); do
  cp ~/.git-templates/hooks/* $repo/hooks/
done
```
