{% include toc title="Index" %}
To combine multiple commits (squash) from the feature branch into one while merging into the develop branch,
an `squash merge` or `interactive rebase`  approach can be used.

# Using IntelliJ Squash

Remove unnecessary commits by squashing intermediate commits into one.

# Rebase
An alternate to merge is Rebase. Rebase is used to integrate changes from one branch to another

### Interactive Rebase

```shell
git rebase -i develop

# pick or squash
pick abc123 First commit message
squash def456 Second commit message
squash hij789 Third commit message
```

If the changes are pushed into the feature branch on the server, then do an interactive rebase with remote/develop

```shell
git rebase -i origin/develop
# squash the commits and then force push
git push --force
```

## When to use Rebase?
When your feature branch is local and changing history will not affect others.

- Use `git rebase` when you want to update your feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch (usually `main` or `develop`).
- It's suitable when you desire a linear commit history for your branch, making it easier to understand the sequence of changes.

> Note: `git rebase` should be used with caution in collaborative environments where rewriting history may affect others.
> In such cases, consider using `git merge` to incorporate changes from the main branch.


# Fast-Forward

When the merge from branch A happens with Branch B, and Branch B does not have new commits, the fast forward merge happens.
You get message "You have performed a fast-forward merge."

If both the branches to be merged has changes, Recursive merge happens.

```shell
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
```
