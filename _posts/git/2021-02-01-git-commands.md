# Useful Commands
Most used git commands after cloning a project. Target is to create a new
feature branch to be used for development and be used for a pull request.

## Create new Feature Branch for development

```sh
# First checkout the branch from which a new branch is to be created
git checkout <existing develop branch> # Example : future-develop
git pull  # Optional

## Pull the latest changes from parent branch into child
# must be in the child branch. Resolve any conflicts
git merge parent

#Create your branch (2 in 1 command)
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
# Make your changes  and commit the files
git commit -m <file names>
# Add the branch remotely
git push -u origin <branch> # (-u short for --set-upstream option)
```

# Switch commits

### uncommited changes

Take uncommitted changes from one branch to another

```sh
# With Git 2.23
git switch -c <new-branch>

# The same could be achieved prior to Git 2.23 by
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

### committed changes

If, by accident, a commit is made in one feature branch, but it was supposed t
be in some other branch

```sh
# Find the commit hash
git cherry-pick 0359ca8b 
```

## Remove Accidental Pushes from Remote

```bash
git rm <filename or folder> # removes the file from the repo butÂ also deletes it from the local file system.

# To remove the file from the remote repo and not delete it from the local file system use:
git rm --cached <filename or folder>

# remove from local as well as remote
git rm -r --cached <filename or folder>

# Then commit the changes
```

## Creating fresh Repository

Creating a fresh Project Local
1. Create a repo on Github and copy the repo name.

2. Create an IntelliJ/ Eclipse Project as a new project and goto that path using command prompt

Execute the following in Command prompt

```sh
# Initialize a repository
git init

# Create .gitignore and put data
vim .gitignore

# ************** Add some data and files *********************
#Add the files you have worked upon
git add . #(it will take care of ignore files)

#Commit the changes
git commit -m "my_message"

#Add the remote Repo git (ONLY FIRST TIME)
git remote add <branch name (any)> <http git repo address>
git remote add origin <http git repo address> OR
git remote add github <http git repo address> # instead of origin, github is the remote branch

#Add the remote Repo git
git push -u origin master (master is our local repo, branch name)
```

## Delete a remote branch using

```sh
git push origin --delete <branchName>
git push origin :old_branch
```

## Delete branch from remote repository

```sh
git push origin --delete [branchname]
```

## Delete branch from local repository

```sh
git branch -d [branchname]
```

## Rename a branch

```sh
# rename a branch while pointed to any branch:
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>

# If you want to rename the current branch, you can simply do:
git branch -m <newname>
```

## Push local branch to repo.

```
 git push --set-upstream origin <Branch name>
 ```

# Stash

```shell
git stash push -m "named_stash"

git stash apply stash^{/named_stash}
```

## View and Clear Stash

Acts as local clipboard to git

```sh
# Clear all the stash in one go
git stash clear

# Find all the stash with index Id
git stash list

git stash pop stash@{n}

# Take the index from the stash list
git stash drop stash@{index}
```

#### Stash from one branch and bring it on another

If changes are made accidentally on a branch where it's not needed, then stash
the changes and then bring back into the other branch

`--keep-index` allows to stash all changes that were not added to staging area.

It safer to run `git stash apply` as it does not remove stashed changes instead
of `git stash pop`. Conflicts might also occur.
