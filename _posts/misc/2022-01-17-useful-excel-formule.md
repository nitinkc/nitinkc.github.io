=VLOOKUP arguments

**Scenario**: *Column X and Y are present in a large set of Data. If a few valus
of X is given, find the corrosponding values of Y against X.*

**Solution**: *Column X(present in a Range or in a Table, as first Column) and
Y (using VLOOKUP)*

* First argument is the value to lookup in the large set of data.
* Second argument is the range or table to look for the value.
* Then, the index of the column where the lookup value is located (indexing
  begins from 1 for X)
* Finally FALSE to find an exact match.
