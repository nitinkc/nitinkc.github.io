movements

# 3 basic assumptions

* Price discounts everything
    * Buy when Fear is at its extreme
    * Sell when Greed is at its extreme
* Price moves in trends
    * if a trend is set, future price movements are more likely to follow that
      trend
    * If the current trend ios high, we can buy at the bottoms and sell at the
      highs
    * If the current trend is downwards, we can short sell the security at the
      highs and make profit in the fall also. NNT
* History tends to repeat itself
    * Charts and patterns found in the past often repeat themselves

# Types of Charts

* Line Chart : connecting the closing price of a Stock over a period
* Bar Chart : should be used to predict the evaluating trends on a longer
  timeframes
    * top is the highest price,
    * bottom at lowest price of the period usually a day
    * tick to the left is the opening price of the period
    * right tickt is the closing price of the period

* Candlestick chart : provides visual insights to current market psychology
    * can be applied to (5M, 15M, 1H, 1D, 1W etc)
        * red candle - stock closes lower than its opening price - bearish
          sentiments or selling pressure
        * green candle - stock closes higher than the opening price - bullish
          sentiments or buying pressure
