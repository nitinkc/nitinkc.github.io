# Book Binding Basics

Print in Booklet mode, both sided, portrait mode for rectangular page (Letter or
A4)

For a 422 page book,

- 10 signatures/sections of 10 sheets, 4 page each sheet(Letter, A4 or A5 paper,
  double side printing)
    - ![singleSignature.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/singleSignature.png)
- 1 last signature of 6 sheets for the last 22 pages
    - ![endSignature.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/endSignature.png)

## Estimation

For a 100 sheet printing (each sheet having 4 pages of print, for a total of 400
page book)

- 25 signatures of 4 sheets (too thin for stitching)
- 20 signatures of 5 sheets
- 10 signatures of 10 sheets (too think for bending and printing, requires edge
  trimming tool)
