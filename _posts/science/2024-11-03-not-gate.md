The 74HC series is a family of high-speed CMOS logic ICs commonly used in digital circuits. These ICs are part of the 7400 series, which is a popular collection of integrated circuits offering a wide range of digital logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and other useful building blocks. The 74HC series specifically stands out for its high-speed CMOS (HC) technology, offering faster performance than the standard 74LS (low-power Schottky) series while maintaining low power consumption.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the 74HC series logic gates and their key features:

1. Basic Logic Gates in the 74HC Series
- 74HC00: Quad 2-input NAND gate
- 74HC02: Quad 2-input NOR gate
- 74HC04: Hex Inverter (NOT gate)
- 74HC08: Quad 2-input AND gate
- 74HC10: Triple 3-input NAND gate
- 74HC20: Dual 4-input NAND gate
- 74HC32: Quad 2-input OR gate
- 74HC86: Quad 2-input XOR gate
