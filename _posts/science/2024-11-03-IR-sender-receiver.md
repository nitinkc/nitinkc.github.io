# IR Transmitter & Receivers
- 3mm 940nm LED Infrared Transmitter and Receiver Diodes

### Transmitter Circuit
- transparent diode

Simple IR Transmitter LED connected with a Resistor, 330 Ohm or higher and connected with battery

### Receiver circuit
With a BLACK receiver photo diode, which is **reverse-biased**,
- connect the **cathode** with the VCC positive, 
- the anode with a resistor and an LED to the ground.

When the 2 circuits are in range, the LED will Glow
