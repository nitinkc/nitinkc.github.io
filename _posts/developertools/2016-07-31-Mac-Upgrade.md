## Upgrading the Macbook Pro : (13-inch, Mid 2012)

* Processor : 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5

I was planning to buy a new Macbook as the one which was gifted by one of my best friends became really slow.

I just checked a few videos on Youtube and found out that just by replacing and changing my HDD to SSD, it will boost up the performance.

Thus I ordered everything online

Opening up the Macbook Pro flap needs special tools, so i ordered a universal tool kit to open all the screws of macbook, iphone and other android phones.

I upgraded
 *   RAM from the original 4GB to 16 GB - Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3L 1600 SODIMM Memory for Mac System(CT2K8G3S160BM )- (Crucible RAM - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
 *  Replaced the original HDD with Samsung SSD - Samsung 850 EVO - 500GB - 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OBRE5UE/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The hard disk that came out cam be used as an external drive using an enclosure. The best one that i liked is
HandAcc 2.5 Inch USB 3.0 Hard Drive External Enclosure Case For 9.5mm & 7mm 2.5" SATA HDD and SSD, Support UASP, Tool-free, Silver
(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015P98F8E/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Before upgrading the SSD, the clone needs to be created from the original HDD. This clone on the new SSD will help use the SSD directly. I have used **Bombich Software's Carbon Copy Cleaner**. The free 30 day trial was enough for me to clone my HDD. It took nearly 6 hours to clone 460GB Data.
