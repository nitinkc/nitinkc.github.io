title: 'MacBook : Brew Package Migration'
---

{% include toc title="Index" %}

# Show top level packages without dependencies

```sh
brew leaves | xargs -n1 brew desc --eval-all
```

Taking all the brew packages from one machine to another machine can be achieved
via brew bundle

```sh
# Run on old machine to gather all the installed packages
brew bundle dump --describe --global #Creates ~/.Brewfile with all installed package information
```

Run the following to install the packages
from [BrewFile](https://github.com/nitinkc/SystemEnvironment/blob/master/mac/.Brewfile)

```sh
brew bundle install --global #--global -> Read the Brewfile from ~/.Brewfile.
```

### Brew maintenance

```shell
brew update && brew outdated && brew upgrade && brew cleanup

# or create alias for repetitive usages
buou='brew update && brew outdated && brew upgrade && brew cleanup'
```
