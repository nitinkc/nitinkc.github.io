# Port Forwarding on Home Router

In order to use the web server truly as a remote web server, we have to make it
accessible outside the LAN. This can be achieved via port forwarding.

Configure the router to forward ports. If an external client sends a request
over a particular port of the router, the router can pass it along to different
IP addresses.

An excellent article can be
found [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/)

Suppose office ip address is `2601:641:101:1800:cc28:72aa:64:a454`

The comcast business router default values are
http://10.1.10.1/
user: cusadmin
password: highspeed

Here the server IP address is the address of the computer inside the LAN running
HTTP Server

# ssh-enabled

* Login to router and enable port forwarding for SSH on port 80.
* Find out the Routers ip-address. This address is exposed to the outside world.
  Find [ipv4/ipv6](http://ipv4.whatismyv6.com/) address.
* Check the status of the ports
  at [You get Signal](http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/)
* Login from any computer in the world using `ssh synergy@67.170.249.191`where
  67.170.249.191 is the Router address.

# Publish Website

Publish your website by keeping the index.html of the project in the directory
/var/www/html.

If the Port Forwarding is set to Port 80 in the Router, you can access the
website using your IP Address from any where in the world.

eg: http://67.170.249.191

Using DDNS service, you can register this IP address with a Domain Name String.

# DNS

Since it is harder to remember IP addresses like 67.170.249.191, use DDNS
service. You can find service providers, both paid and free. One free provider
