name of the OS/print hardware name

```sh
uname

uname -m
```

``` sudo Purge ``` Clear RAM

Find CPU related info

```sh
sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string

system_profiler | grep Processor

sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu

sysctl hw.cpufrequency # query the CPU speed
``` 

## Displaying Current Environment & Shell Variables in Mac OS X

get a list of environmental variables

```
printenv
```

complete list of shell variables, the ‘set’ command:

```
set 
```

To show a list including the "shell variables" you can enter the next command:

```
( set -o posix ; set ) | less
```

The output of these commands can be lengthy so you may wish to pipe the output
through the less or more commands.

Bash History

```sh
history |grep "defaults"
```

Find out the shell

```sh
finger $USER
echo $0
echo $SHELL
```

'find' with 'xargs' command. xargs works on the result of the find command

```sh
find . -name "*.java" -print0 | xargs -0 wc
```

It's slightly trickier to use 'xargs' when the command you want to run takes
other arguments and the list of files has to come before those other arguments.
For example, if you wanted to copy all those ".java" files to a different
folder, you'd want to use the 'cp' command. But it has the form:
cp file1 file2 file3 ... destinationFolder

To get 'xargs' to insert the list of files at a specified place in the command
line, you use the "-J" option and supply your choice of placeholder - for
example:

```sh
find . -name "*.java" -print0 | xargs -0 -J % cp % destinationFolder 
```

## Processes

* ps ("process status") - to see detailed info about the processes running
* top - to get a summary of the processes running and resource consumption
* kill - to terminate a process identified by process-id (or to send other
  signals)
* killall - to terminate a process identified by program name
* lsof ("list open files") - show which files (and sockets) are open by which
  program
* fs_usage ("filesystem usage") - show which programs are accessing (reading or
  writing) the * filesystem
* dtrace - trace any system activity (processes or file access). Start by
  reading 'man -k dtrace'

## System Info

* hostname - reports the name of your Mac
* sw_vers - reports the OS X version that you are using
* system_profiler - reports on the hardware and software that is on your Mac (
  i.e. a command-line * version of the "System Profiler" utility)
