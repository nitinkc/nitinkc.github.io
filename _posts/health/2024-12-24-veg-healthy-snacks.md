# Black Bean Burger
**Ingredients**:
- 3 cups black beans, cooked, drained, and rinsed
- 1/8 cup medium yellow onion, grated
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, diced
- 2 Tbsp adobo sauce
- 1 Tbsp tamari
- 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 cup panko
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing
- Hamburger buns and desired fixings, for serving

**Instructions**:
1. In a large bowl, combine the beans, onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tamari, vinegar, cumin, salt, and pepper.
2. Mash until the mixture holds together but still has some visible chunks of black beans. Add the egg and fold until combined. Fold in the panko.
3. Form the mixture into 6 patties. Refrigerate for 20 minutes if too wet to handle.
4. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, brush with olive oil, and cook the burgers for about 5 minutes per side.
5. Alternatively, grill the patties at 400Â°F for 8 minutes on the first side and 4 minutes on the second side.

- **Servings**: Makes 6 servings.

- **Tip**: For a vegan version, replace the egg with 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 2 1/2 Tbsp warm water and let it thicken for 5 minutes. Increase cooking time by 2 minutes when grilling.
