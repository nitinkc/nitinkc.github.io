# Agile Fundamentals

Agile is an iterative approach to software development and project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The **Agile Manifesto** (2001) defines four core values:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

# Scrum Framework

Scrum is the most popular Agile framework, designed for teams of 3-9 members working in time-boxed iterations called **Sprints**.

## Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner (PO)**: Owns the product backlog, prioritizes work, defines acceptance criteria
- **Scrum Master (SM)**: Facilitates ceremonies, removes impediments, coaches the team
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional team that delivers the increment (typically 5-7 members)

## Scrum Artifacts

### Epic
Large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Epics typically span multiple sprints and represent major features or initiatives.
- **Example**: "Implement user authentication system"
- **Timeline**: Multiple sprints (weeks to months)

### User Story
A small, valuable piece of functionality written from the end-user perspective.
- **Format**: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [reason]"
- **Example**: "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account"
- **Size**: Should be completable within one sprint

### Task
A technical piece of work required to complete a user story.
- **Example**: "Create database migration for password reset tokens"
- **Size**: Few hours to 2 days

### Spike
A time-boxed research or investigation activity to answer a question or gather information.
- **Purpose**: Reduce technical uncertainty, explore solutions
- **Example**: "Research best OAuth 2.0 libraries for our tech stack"
- **Timeline**: Usually 1-3 days, always time-boxed

### Bug
A defect or issue in existing functionality that needs to be fixed.

### Technical Debt
Code that needs refactoring or improvement to maintain system quality.

## Story Points vs Hours

**Story Points** (Recommended by Scrum Guide):
- Relative measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty
- Common scales: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) or T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Focus on relative sizing, not absolute time

**Hours** (Traditional approach):
- Absolute time estimates
- Less preferred in Agile due to variability and estimation difficulties

# Agile Ceremonies (Events)

## Sprint
**What**: Fixed time-box (iteration) for completing work
- **Duration**: 1-4 weeks (2 weeks is most common in industry)
- **Original Recommendation**: 2-4 weeks (Scrum Guide)
- **Output**: Potentially shippable product increment

## Sprint Planning
**What**: Team plans the work for the upcoming sprint
- **Duration**: Max 8 hours for 4-week sprint (typically 2-4 hours for 2-week sprint)
- **Participants**: Entire Scrum Team
- **Goals**:
  - Define Sprint Goal
  - Select items from Product Backlog
  - Create Sprint Backlog with detailed tasks
- **When**: First day of the sprint

## Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)
**What**: Brief daily sync to inspect progress and adapt plan
- **Duration**: 15 minutes (time-boxed)
- **Participants**: Development Team (PO and SM optional)
- **Format**: Each team member answers:
  1. What did I do yesterday?
  2. What will I do today?
  3. Are there any impediments?
- **When**: Same time every day
- **Industry Practice**: Often happens in morning (9-10 AM)

## Backlog Refinement (Grooming)
**What**: Review and prepare backlog items for future sprints
- **Duration**: ~10% of sprint capacity (2-4 hours per 2-week sprint)
- **Participants**: PO, SM, and Development Team members
- **Goals**:
  - Add details, estimates, and acceptance criteria
  - Break down large items
  - Re-prioritize based on value
- **When**: Mid-sprint, ongoing activity (not an official Scrum event but widely practiced)

### Estimation Techniques

#### Planning Poker
**What**: Collaborative estimation technique where team members independently estimate story points
- **Process**:
  1. PO presents user story
  2. Team discusses and asks questions
  3. Each member selects a card (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
  4. All reveal cards simultaneously
  5. Discuss differences (especially highest and lowest)
  6. Re-vote until consensus
- **Benefits**: Reduces anchoring bias, encourages discussion, builds shared understanding

#### Story Pointing
**What**: Assigning relative effort estimates to user stories
- **Factors Considered**:
  - Complexity: How difficult is the work?
  - Uncertainty: How much is unknown?
  - Effort: How much work is involved?
- **Scale**: Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) or T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Reference Story**: Teams often use a well-understood story as baseline (e.g., "Login is a 5")

### The Three Amigos
**What**: Collaboration between three perspectives before development begins
- **Who**: Product Owner (Business) + Developer (Technical) + Tester (Quality)
- **When**: During backlog refinement or before sprint planning
- **Goals**:
  - Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Identify edge cases and test scenarios
  - Discuss technical approach
  - Ensure shared understanding
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes per story
- **Output**: Well-defined story with clear acceptance criteria and test cases

### Parking Lot
**What**: A place to capture off-topic discussions or issues that arise during meetings
- **Purpose**: Keep meetings focused while acknowledging important topics
- **Process**:
  1. Write item on parking lot (board, doc, or backlog)
  2. Continue with meeting agenda
  3. Address parking lot items after meeting or in appropriate forum
- **Common Uses**: New ideas during sprint planning, technical discussions during standup, impediments that need separate attention

### Bullpen
**What**: Open workspace arrangement where team members sit together
- **Purpose**: Facilitate communication, collaboration, and osmotic learning
- **Characteristics**:
  - Co-located team members
  - Minimal barriers between team members
  - Easy to overhear conversations (information radiators)
  - Quick ad-hoc discussions
- **Modern Practice**: With remote work, "virtual bullpen" through always-on video/chat channels

## Sprint Review (Demo)
**What**: Inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog
- **Duration**: Max 4 hours for 4-week sprint (typically 1-2 hours for 2-week sprint)
- **Participants**: Scrum Team + Stakeholders
- **Goals**:
  - Demo completed work
  - Gather feedback
  - Discuss what's next
- **When**: Last day of sprint (or second-to-last day)

## Sprint Retrospective (Retro)
**What**: Team reflects on process and identifies improvements
- **Duration**: Max 3 hours for 4-week sprint (typically 1-1.5 hours for 2-week sprint)
- **Participants**: Scrum Team only
- **Goals**:
  - What went well?
  - What didn't go well?
  - What will we improve next sprint?
- **When**: After Sprint Review, before next Sprint Planning
- **Industry Practice**: Action items are tracked and reviewed

# Typical 2-Week Sprint Timeline

```
Week 1:
- Monday 9:00 AM: Sprint Planning (2-3 hours)
- Tuesday-Friday 9:00 AM: Daily Standup (15 min)
- Wednesday 2:00 PM: Backlog Refinement (2 hours)

Week 2:
- Monday-Thursday 9:00 AM: Daily Standup (15 min)
- Thursday 2:00 PM: Sprint Review (1-2 hours)
- Friday 9:00 AM: Sprint Retrospective (1-1.5 hours)
- Friday 11:00 AM: Next Sprint Planning (2-3 hours)
```

# Scrum Metrics

## Velocity
Average story points completed per sprint over time. Used for capacity planning.
- **Industry Practice**: Calculate as rolling average of last 3-5 sprints

## Burndown Chart
Shows remaining work in the sprint over time. Helps track if team is on track.

## Burnup Chart
Shows completed work over time. Better for tracking scope changes.

## Sprint Commitment vs Completion
Percentage of committed work actually completed. Target: 80-100%

# Scrum Board

A visual representation of work status, typically with columns:
- **To Do**: Work selected but not started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review/Testing**: Completed but awaiting validation
- **Done**: Meets Definition of Done

**Industry Practice**: Many teams add additional columns like "Code Review", "QA Testing", or "Blocked"

A Scrum board is visible in both:
- **Plan mode**: Backlog view for future work
- **Work mode**: Active Sprint view for current work

# Definition of Done (DoD)

A shared understanding of what "complete" means for a user story or increment.

**Typical DoD checklist**:
- Code written and reviewed
- Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Acceptance criteria met
- Deployed to staging environment
- Product Owner accepted

# Jira Board

JIRA Agile (Jira Software) is a popular tool for Scrum teams.

- Everything in JIRA is called an **issue**
  - Types: Epic, Story, Task, Bug, Spike, Sub-task
- Each issue can be assigned, estimated, and tracked
- JIRA tracks Burndown Chart, Velocity Chart, Sprint Reports

**Two Agile modes**:
- **Scrum**: For teams with fixed-length sprints and defined ceremonies
- **Kanban**: For continuous flow, no sprints, WIP limits

## Jira Concepts

**Epics**: Like buckets grouping similar user stories

**Versions**: Software releases with new features (used for release planning)

**Components**: Architectural areas or team boundaries

**Labels**: Flexible tagging for additional categorization

# Kanban vs Scrum

| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Iterations** | Fixed sprints | Continuous flow |
| **Roles** | PO, SM, Dev Team | No prescribed roles |
| **Ceremonies** | 5 ceremonies | Optional standup |
| **Changes** | No mid-sprint changes | Changes anytime |
| **Metrics** | Velocity, Burndown | Lead time, Cycle time |
| **Best For** | Fixed deadlines, predictable delivery | Continuous delivery, support |

# Industry Best Practices

1. **Keep sprints consistent**: Don't change sprint length frequently
2. **Limit WIP (Work In Progress)**: Focus on finishing over starting
3. **Definition of Ready**: Ensure stories are ready before Sprint Planning
4. **Protect sprint scope**: Avoid adding work mid-sprint
5. **Time-box everything**: Respect ceremony time limits
6. **Automate**: CI/CD pipelines for faster feedback
7. **Co-location or video**: Face-to-face communication when possible
8. **Sprint Goal**: Every sprint should have a clear, singular goal
9. **Team stability**: Keep teams together for at least 3-6 sprints
10. **Continuous improvement**: Actually implement retro action items
