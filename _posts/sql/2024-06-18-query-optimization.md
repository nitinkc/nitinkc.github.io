[Query Execution Plan](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101?tab=readme-ov-file#visualizing-a-sql-query)

## explain plan, performance tuning.

The EXPLAIN PLAN statement displays execution plans chosen by the Oracle
optimizer for SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements.

A statement's execution plan is the sequence of operations Oracle performs to
run the statement.

## Syntax for finding indexes in tuning.

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to
speed up data retrieval.

An index is a pointer to data in a table.

> Indexes are a performance drag when the time comes to modify records.


Multiple Conditions : AND <br>

``` sql
SELECT * from EMP WHERE salary > 10000 AND dateofjoining > ‘1-Jan-1990’ ;
```

Range Selection - BETWEEN

``` sql
SELECT * from EMP WHERE salary between 9000 AND 20000;
```

Exact List Matching

```sql
SELECT *
from EMP
WHERE employeeID IN (3001, 3002);
```

### Full table scan

- A full table scan occurs when an index is either not used or there is no index
  on the table(s)
- Full table scans should be avoided when reading large tables.For example, a
  full table scan is performed when a table that does not have an index is read
- FTS will be performed even though an index is present on that table.
+ If a query does have a WHERE clause, but none of the columns in that WHERE
  clause match.
+ when WHERE clause prevents the use of an index like below.
+ If the NOT EQUAL (the “<>“) operator is used.
+ If the NOT operator is used.
+ If the wildcard operator is used in the first position of a comparison string.
  An example is “WHERE NAME LIKE ‘%INTERVIEW%'”.

# DB Index

A database index is like an efficient **lookup table** that allows a database to
find data much faster. It uses Data structues like B-Tree, HashMap, Bitmaps etc.

- index helps to avoid full scan for a single row in a massive table
- with index, the pointer helps to get the exact address of the indexed column

An index on a non-primary column allows the database to quickly locate rows
based on the indexed column's values, without scanning the entire table

- columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, or ORDER
  BY clauses are good candidates for indexing.

@startuml

entity "Employees" as Employees {

+ employee_id : INT
  --
  first_name : VARCHAR(50)
  last_name : VARCHAR(50)
  email : VARCHAR(100)
  department : VARCHAR(50)
  hire_date : DATE
  --
  PRIMARY KEY(employee_id)
  }

Creating index for Employees Table

```sql
CREATE
INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);
       
-- Analyze Query Performance
EXPLAIN
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

Composite Index

```sql
CREATE
INDEX idx_first_last_name ON employees(first_name, last_name);
-- Analyze Query Performance
EXPLAIN
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'John'
  AND last_name = 'Doe';
```

# Types of Database Indexes

### Key Attributes based:

**Primary Index**: Automatically created when a primary key constraint is
defined on a table.

**Clustered Index**
A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table.
A table can have only **one clustered index** because the data rows can be
stored in only one order.

The primary index is usually a clustered index, but a clustered index can be
created on other columns as well.

When a table has a clustered index, the data rows are stored in the same order
as the index.

A clustered index is most useful for **searching in a range**. Only one
clustered index can exist per table.

```sql
CREATE
CLUSTERED INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);
-- The data rows in the employees table will be stored in the order of the department values.
```

**Non-clustered or Secondary Index**: This index does not store data in the
order of the index. Instead, it provides a list of virtual pointers or
references to the location where the data is actually stored.

@startuml
entity "Employees" as Employees {

+ employee_id : INT
  --
  first_name : VARCHAR(50)
  last_name : VARCHAR(50)
  email : VARCHAR(100)
  department : VARCHAR(50)
  hire_date : DATE
  --
  PRIMARY KEY(employee_id)
  }

note "Primary Index on employee_id (Clustered)" as Primary
Primary .. Employees

entity "Secondary Index on last_name" as Secondary {
--
last_name : VARCHAR(50)
--
}
Secondary .. Employees

entity "Clustered Index on department" as Clustered {
--
department : VARCHAR(50)
--
}
Clustered .. Employees

### Data Coverage based:

**Dense index**: Has an entry for every search key value in the table. Suitable
for situations where the data has a small number of distinct search key values
or when fast access to individual records is required.

**Sparse index**: Has entries only for some of the search key values. Suitable
for situations where the data has a large number of distinct search key values.

**Specialized Index Types**:
Bitmap Index: Excellent for columns with low cardinality (few distinct values).
Common in data warehousing.

**Hash Index**: A index that uses a hash function to map values to specific
locations. Great for exact match queries.

**Filtered Index**: Indexes a subset of rows based on a specific filter
condition. Useful to improve query speed on commonly filtered columns.

**Covering Index**: Includes all the columns required by a query in the index
itself, eliminating the need to access the underlying table data.

**Function-based index**: Indexes that are created based on the result of a
function or expression applied to one or more columns of a table.

**Full-Text Index**: A index designed for full-text search, allowing for
efficient searching of text data.

**Spatial Index**: Used for indexing geographical data types.

# Datastructures used in Indexing
Indices can be saved in
- B-Tree (Balanced Tree) or variation of it 
- HashMaps
- Bitmap Index

For where clause, comparisons should be SARGABLE - **S**earch **ARG**ument **ABLE**

- refers to queries that can use indices for faster execution

## B-Tree Index

B-Tree indices are commonly used for columns with a wide range of values and
support equality and range queries efficiently.

Range Query

```sql
-- Assuming an index on the `salary` column
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000;
```

Composite Index Query

```sql
-- Assuming a composite index on the `last_name` and `first_name` columns
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Smith'
  AND first_name = 'John';
```

## Bitmap Index

Bitmap indices are more efficient for columns with a low cardinality, such as
gender or status columns.

Equality Query on Low Cardinality Column

```sql
-- Assuming a bitmap index on the `gender` column
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE gender = 'F';
```

Ensuring SARGABLE Queries

# Do's and Dont's

Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns: Functions on indexed columns prevent the use
of the index.

```sql
-- Not SARGABLE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 2020;

-- SARGABLE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';
```

Avoid Operations on Indexed Columns: Operations on indexed columns also prevent
the use of the index.

```sql
-- Not SARGABLE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary + 1000 = 50000;

-- SARGABLE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = 49000;
```

Use AND for Composite Indexes: Ensure all parts of the composite index are used
in the query.

```sql
-- Assuming a composite index on (last_name, first_name)
-- Not fully SARGABLE (only uses part of the index)
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Smith';

-- Fully SARGABLE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Smith'
  AND first_name = 'John';
```
