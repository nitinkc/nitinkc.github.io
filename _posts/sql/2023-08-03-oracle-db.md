GRANT SELECT ON employees TO john;
```

- Revoke INSERT permission on the "products" table from the role "managers":

```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON products FROM managers;
```

# DDL (Data Definition Language):

- Create a new table named "customers":

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
   customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
   customer_name VARCHAR2(100),
   email VARCHAR2(50)
);
```

- Add a new column "phone" to the "employees" table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD phone VARCHAR2(20);
```

- Drop the "orders" table:

```sql
DROP TABLE orders;
  ```

# Operators:

- Comparison Operator Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;
```

- Arithmetic Operator Example:

```sql
SELECT quantity * price AS total_amount FROM orders;
```

- Logical Operator Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York' AND status = 'Active';
```

# OFFSET - LIMIT

- Return 10 rows starting from the 6th row (pagination):

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY emp_id OFFSET 5 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

# Aggregate Functions:

- Calculate the total number of employees:

```sql
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
```

- Calculate the average salary of employees in the "Finance" department:

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

# GROUP BY:

- Get the total sales amount for each product:

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY product_name;
```

# Joins:

- INNER JOIN example:

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

- LEFT JOIN example:

```sql
SELECT employees.emp_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

# Subquery:

- Get all employees whose salary is higher than the average salary in the "
  Finance" department:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance');
```

# Window Functions (Analytic Functions):

- Assign a rank to employees based on their salaries in descending order:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

- Calculate the running total of sales for each product:

```sql
SELECT product_name, sales_amount, SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY sales_date) AS running_total
FROM sales;
```
