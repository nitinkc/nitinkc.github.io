# Create Graph from List of Edges List
if edges array `edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]` is given, first create a graph before applying DFS or BFS
{% gist nitinkc/132dd893ba5f15047e4719a597ed712e  %}

If graph consists of integer nodes beginning 0 or 1, simply use an array and take advantage of the indices of the list
{% gist nitinkc/b12ef44d71f8923525d4e4693cc534ed  %}


# Visited Array
Can use a set of type node `HashSet<Node>` for both 1D and 2D arrays
- A `HashSet<Node> visited` can be used used to keep track of visited node
  - use `visited.add(r+""+c)` for 2D grids
  - use `visited.contains(r+""+c)`

Can simply use boolean array
```java
// For 1D Array
boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];//Initialized with False
for(Integer i : adj.get(currentVertex)){
  //If neighbor is not visited, add in the Queue or recurse for DFS and make it visited
  if(!visited[i]){
      stack.push(i);
      //q.add(i);
      visited[i] = true;
  }
  
//For grid
int[][] visit = new int[ROWS][COLS];
```

If you are allowed to change the grid, the simple change the value to a negative scenario

# Navigating along the grid
I find it a bit complicated

{% gist nitinkc/ff5e06a561fd90af1a0236a7d284849e  %}

Use the direction array with ints

{% gist nitinkc/6f9bebfbbf3141f631064f6b3f89a1c8  %}


# Depth First Search (DFS)
- Traverse **all paths between any two vertices** in a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù.
- Traversing all Vertices
- Traversing all paths between two vertices

## Recursion
{% gist nitinkc/cf336b33d9a9f0ca8cc7b07a0cd06598 %}

## AdjacencyList
{% gist nitinkc/eb2679981de3dddc1b1d5e064ce3fcf9  %}

## Grid DFS
{% gist nitinkc/75ee2263e51ae2078af4e1dbacce9c0f  %}

## Tests With Stack (Prefer DFS Recursion instead)
In place of the Stack if a queue is used, then the same algo becomes BFS

[//]: # ({% gist nitinkc/aede10b385437c2d861cce9ebaabbe41 %})

[//]: # ({% gist nitinkc/06bd79e6102000bc603b72e386a23811 %})


## Recursive backtracking - DFS
**Base case for recursion**
```java
//Base cases
if(//Covering the 4 corners
    r < 0 || c < 0 //Math.min(r,c) < 0 //Left & Upper bound
    || r == grid.length //right bound
    || c == grid[0].length //lower bound
    // Blockers as per the problem
    || grid[r][c] == 1 //Blocked
    //Visited check
    || visited.contains(r+""+c) //Already Visited
  ){
    return ...;//Depends if count is needed or a void is returned
}
```

**Terminating conditions, if there is one fixed condition.**
- [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/)

```java
//Terminating condition, when the rightmost Bottom corner is reached
if(r == grid.length-1 && c == grid[0].length-1){
    return 1;
}
```

**If all possibilities are to be searched**
- [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)
- [River Sizes](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/river-sizes)

```java
int count = 0;
HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++){
        if(grid[i][j] == '1' && !visited.contains(i+""+j)){
            count++;
            gridDFS(grid,i,j,visited);
        }
     }
}
```

**The directions array comes handy with BFS as there are no recursive calls**

```java
private static final int[][] directions = {
        {1, 0}, //Next Row ‚Üí , r-1, Keeping Column constant
        {-1, 0}, //Previous Row ‚Üê, r+1
        {0, 1}, //Column above ‚Üë, c+1, Keeping Row constant
        {0, -1}}; //Column above ‚Üì, c-1

//while performing dfs
for (int[] dir : directions) {
    dfs(grid, r + dir[0], c + dir[1]);
}
```

##### Using Recursion
Pass the updated `visited` array so that the other calls have the updated set

```java
//Recursive Backtracking
gridDFS(grid,r,c+1,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r,c-1,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r+1,c,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r-1,c,visited);
```

### Complexity
**Time Complexity**: $ O(V+E) $
- ùëâ represents the number of vertices, and
- ùê∏ represents the number of edges.
- We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.

**Space Complexity**: $ ùëÇ(ùëâ^2) $
- created stack or the recursive call stack can store up to V‚ãÖV vertices
- worst case - each vertex has edges connecting to all other vertices.


# Breadth First Search  - BFS
- Finding **the shortest path** between two vertices in a graph where all edges have
  equal and positive weights.


* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is
  preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
* In AI(Machine Learning) Robots can discover surroundings more easily from BFS
  than DFS
* Important in Maximum Flow - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
