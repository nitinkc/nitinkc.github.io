{% include toc title="Index" %}

- `int asciiValue = (int) 'A'`
    - `'A' - 0` - Zero as an integer, works only for alphabets, returns ASCII
      values of the alphabet
        - ```java
        int intValueOfChar = 'A' - 0;//65 
      ```
- Integer representation of a integer Character with int casting or subtraction
  with character 0
- `int x = '9' - '0';` is used to convert a character representing a digit to
  its corresponding integer value.
    - In ASCII, the characters '0' to '9' are represented by consecutive
      values (48 to 57, respectively).
    - If c is '0', then c - '0' evaluates to 48 - 48, resulting in 0.
    - If c is '1', then c - '0' evaluates to 49 - 48, resulting in 1.
    - If c is '2', then c - '0' evaluates to 50 - 48, resulting in 2
- `int x = Character.getNumericValue(c);` does the same as above

### Character.getNumericValue()

Use only for numerical characters to get the int value from character

### Character.toLowerCase()

While comparing individual characters of a String, this comes handy.

```java
Character.toLowerCase('A')
``` 

Note: To evenly handle even an odd length Strings, use While loop with the
condition  `start < end` with pointers running from both end

### Character.isLetterOrDigit()

Identify if a character is alphanumeric or **Skipping punctuation marks**

```java
Character.isLetterOrDigit(str.charAt(i))
```

### isLetter() & OrDigit()

```java
char c = '9';
Character.isDigit(c);//True
c = 'S';
Character.isLetter(c).//True
```
