- Set takes only single instance of an element.
- While adding an element into a set, **a test of equality** happens, to determine if the object being pushed already exist.
    - Thus override equals & hashCode methods in case of non-primitive Objects

- With primitives, no need to override hashCode() and equals()

### Declaration and important methods.

With Tree set, sorts to Default Natural Sorting Order, in case of primitives and Boxed type.

##### Sets RetainAll
[Count Common Problem](https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/view/bjp5/chapter11/e7-countCommon)

set1.retainAll(set2) -> retains all the common elements, like intersection
