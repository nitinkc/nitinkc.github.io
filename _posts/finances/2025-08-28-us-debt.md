## How US Debt Works

When foreign countries or investors buy US Treasury securities (bonds, notes, bills), 
they are effectively lending money to the US government. 

In return, the US pays interest on these securities.

The interest payments on US debt are funded by tax revenues collected from individuals and businesses.

## US as the Largest Debtor

The United States is the largest debtor nation in the world, with a national debt exceeding \$30 trillion as of 2025.

## Major Foreign Holders of US Debt

- **Japan:** Over \$1.1 trillion
- **United Kingdom:** Approximately \$809 billion
- **China:** Approximately \$756 billion
- **India:** \$242 billion (12th largest holder)

China and Japan are the two largest foreign holders of US Treasury securities, making them significant lenders to the US.

## Why Countries Buy US Debt

- Safely invest their trade surpluses
- Stabilize their own currencies
- Maintain liquidity in global markets

## Impact on US Economy

policy and government spending.
