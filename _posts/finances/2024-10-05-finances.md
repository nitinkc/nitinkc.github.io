# EMI Formula
[Reducing-Balance Method](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/equated-monthly-installment-emi)

$$ EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} $$

## EMI for 7.5% interest rate for a principal amount of $500,000 Over 30 Years
[calculator - mortgage-loan](https://www.oakstarbank.com/calculator/mortgage-loan)

$$ r = \frac{7.5}{100 \times 12} = 0.00625 $$

$$ EMI = \frac{500000 \times 0.00625 \times (1 + 0.00625)^{360}}{(1 + 0.00625)^{360} - 1} \approx 3,507.24 $ $$
