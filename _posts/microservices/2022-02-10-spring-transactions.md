# Summary
**Transaction Propagation**

Propagation defines how transactions behave when a method is called **within
an existing transaction**. The common propagation types are:

- **REQUIRED**: (Default) If a transaction exists, use it; otherwise, create a new one.
- **REQUIRES_NEW**: Always create a new transaction, suspending the existing one if necessary.
- **SUPPORTS**: If a transaction exists, use it; otherwise, proceed without a transaction.
- **NOT_SUPPORTED**: Always proceed without a transaction, suspending any existing transaction.
- **MANDATORY**: A transaction must exist; throws an exception if none exists.
- **NEVER**: A transaction should not exist; throws an exception if one does.
- **NESTED**: Executes within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists, otherwise behaves like REQUIRED.

**Transaction Isolation Levels**

Isolation defines the degree to which a transaction is isolated from the effects
of other concurrent transactions. The levels are:
- **DEFAULT**: Inherits the default isolation level of the underlying database.
- **READ_UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads (reading uncommitted data).
- **READ_COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.
- **REPEATABLE_READ**: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but may allow phantom reads.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Highest isolation level, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by locking the data.

```java
// Requires new propagation, serializable isolation, rollback on checked exceptions
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW, 
               isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE, 
               rollbackFor = Exception.class)
public void requiresNewTransaction() throws Exception {
    myRepository.saveData();
    // Simulate a checked exception
    if (true) throw new Exception("Checked exception, triggering rollback");
}

// Supports propagation, read committed isolation
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.SUPPORTS, 
               isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED)
public void supportsTransaction() {
    myRepository.saveData();
```

# Spring Transactions

Transactions typically group related operations that should be treated as a
**single unit of work**, allowing for
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

Spring transactions are commonly used for operations within **a single database** (
could be distributed db for Distributed Transactions).

Spring provides robust support for transaction management in 
- relational databases, 
- NoSQL databases, and 
- other data access technologies.

Whether you're using JDBC, JPA (Java Persistence API),
Hibernate, or Spring Data JPA,
Spring's transaction management can be applied to ensure **data integrity and
consistency within a single database**.

[Spring Project for the topic](https://github.com/nitinkc/Spring-Transactions/tree/master/src/main/java/com/learn/transaction/myAdmissionService)

## Admission Service Example

All are within one DB, inserting data into multiple tables within one DB

1. Register a Student
2. Register Student in Department
3. Register Student in Hostel (Optional and based on Gender)
4. Register Student in a Society (Optional)

The transaction is propagated in the same order as mentioned above.

[Tx Propagation](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction-propagation)

### @Transactional
**Method-Level @Transactional**
- method should execute within a transaction.
- Transactional behavior is applied only to the annotated method. 
  - Other methods within the same class are not affected.
- This allows for fine-grained control over transactional behavior,
    - enables to specify different transactional settings for different methods
      within the same class.

**Class-Level @Transactional:**
- When you annotate a class with @Transactional, all **public methods** of that
  class become transactional
- if a method within the class is annotated with `@Transactional`, 
**it overrides the class-level annotation** for that specific method.
- This provides a convenient way to apply a default transactional behavior to
  all methods in the class without explicitly annotating each method.

> Let's consider a transaction : `Student Service -> Department Service`

### **REQUIRED** (Default Transaction Propagation)
This is the default propagation behavior if not specified explicitly.
- It always executes in a transaction.
- If there is an existing transaction, it participates in it; otherwise, it
  creates a new one.

If StudentService is not annotated with `@Transactional`, and DepartmentService
is annotated with
`@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)`, then a new transaction
will be created by DepartmentService if none exists.

### **MANDATORY**
Always executes in a transaction. It requires an existing transaction;
- otherwise, **it throws an exception**.

If StudentService is not annotated with `@Transactional`, and DepartmentService
is annotated with
`@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)`, and if DepartmentService
is invoked without an existing transaction, it will throw an exception.

```java
nested exception is org.springframework.transaction.IllegalTransactionStateException: 
    No existing transaction found for transaction marked with propagation 'mandatory'] with root cause
org.springframework.transaction.IllegalTransactionStateException: 
    No existing transaction found for transaction marked with propagation 'mandatory' 
```

### **NEVER**
It executes without any transaction context. It throws an exception if an
existing transaction is found.
If StudentService has a transactional annotation and DepartmentService is
annotated with
`@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)`, and if DepartmentService is
invoked within a
transactional context, it will throw an exception.

Then there should be an exception. In the Replicated Example, appears that the
default save method of
JPA creates an internal Tx which is why it works.

### **REQUIRES_NEW**
It always executes in a new transaction. It suspends the existing transaction if
any.

Irrespective of the Calling method, the new Transaction is created.
If the calling method has a Tx, then its suspended and gets resumed after the
called Tx is completed.

If StudentService is called within a transaction, and it invokes
DepartmentService
annotated with `@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)`, the
existing transaction in StudentService
is suspended, and a new transaction is created for the execution of
DepartmentService.

# Isolation - For Concurrent Transactions

The default transaction isolation taken is that of the **underlying database**.

* The default isolation level is **REPEATABLE READ**  for MySQL database.
* H2 - The default is **read committed**. H2 supports only three isolation
  levels; read uncommitted, read committed and serializable
  which can only be set at the connection level (not per transaction).
* Oracle only supports **read committed** (default) and serializable.

## Isolation Problems
- [Isolation Eg](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction-isolation)
-[Isolation Article](https://medium.com/@elliotchance/sql-transaction-isolation-levels-explained-50d1a2f90d8f)

* **Dirty Reads** : When current transaction reads a row written by another
  uncommitted transaction that is in progress.
* **Non-repeatable Reads** : It occurs when current transaction reads the same
  data within one Transaction, but gets two
  different values, because another transaction has been committed during the
  life of the current transaction.
* **Phantom Reads** : (special case of non-repeatable read) A phantom read
  happens when current transaction re-executes
  a query with search condition, receiving different results, because there has
  been a recently-committed transaction
  between two reads of the current Transaction.

## SQL Solution

The SQL Standard defines four isolation levels

* **Read uncommitted** permits dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom
  reads.
* **Read committed** permits non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
* **Repeatable read** permits only phantom reads.
* **Serializable** does not permit any read errors but is slower as it is
  absolute Isolation.

# Rollback

Programmatically handle roll back in the event of a checked exception.

In case of a checked exceptions the previously executed transactions do not get
rolled back automatically even if transaction annotation is used.
This is achieved via the RollbackFor annotation.

A checked exception is a type of exception that must be either caught or
declared in the method in which it is thrown

Example: With Admission Service, if an invalid Hostel Exception is thrown, then
the Tx prior to Hostel Tx (Student and Department) would be committed
successfully, which is not desirable.
The requirement here is to have Student, Department, Hostel and Society Txs to
be completed in its entirety or not committed at all.

```java
@Transactional(rollbackFor = InvalidHostelException.class)
   public void addStudent(Student student, Department department, Hostel hostel, Society society)
                        throws InvalidHostelException {
}
```
