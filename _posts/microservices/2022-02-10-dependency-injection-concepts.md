# Dependency Injection Concepts using Spring 5

**IOC(Inversion Of Control)**

Giving control to the container to get instance of object is called Inversion of
Control.

* instead of you are creating object using new operator, let the container do
  that for you.

**DI(Dependency Injection)**: Way of injecting properties to an object is called
Dependency injection.

We have three types of Dependency injection

* Constructor Injection
* Setter/Getter Injection
* Interface Injection

Spring support only Constructor Injection and Setter/Getter Injection.

### Dependency Injection is done in 3 ways

1. By class properties - least preferred

* Using private properties is <span style="color:red">**EVIL**</span>

2. By Setters - Area of much debate

```java
private GreetingService greetingService;
@Autowired
//@Qualifier("setterGreetingService")
public void setGreetingService(@Qualifier("setterGreetingService") GreetingService greetingService) {
    this.greetingService = greetingService;
}
```

3. By Constructor - Most Preferred

```java
private GreetingService greetingService;
//Constructor, With Spring 5 no need to explicitly mention @Autowired, but its a good practice
public A3ConstructorInjectedController(GreetingService greetingService) {
    this.greetingService = greetingService;
}
```

#### DI via Interfaces is highly preferred

* Allows runtime to decide implementation to inject
* Follows Interface Segregation Principle of SOLID
* Also, makes your code more testable

**Types of Injection:**

##### Field Injection

AVOID THIS
{: .notice--danger}
it's generally not recommended because it makes testing and mocking dependencies
more challenging.

**Constructor injection is preferred for better testability.**

You can annotate a class field directly with `@Autowired`. Spring will find the
appropriate
bean to inject based on the field's type.

```java
@Service
public class StudentServiceWithDb {
  @Autowired
  private StudentRepository studentRepository;

  @Autowired
  private StudentMapper studentMapper;

  // Other methods of StudentServiceWithDb
}
```

##### Setter Injection

AVOID THIS
{: .notice--danger}
Like field injection, it's less recommended than constructor injection for the
same reasonsâ€”it can make testing and mocking dependencies more complex.

Annotate a setter method with @Autowired. Spring will call this method and pass
the required dependency when
initializing the bean.

```java
@Service
public class StudentServiceWithDb {
  private StudentRepository studentRepository;
  private StudentMapper studentMapper;

  //Setter Injection
  @Autowired
  public void setStudentRepository(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
    this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
  }

  @Autowired
  public void setStudentMapper(StudentMapper studentMapper) {
    this.studentMapper = studentMapper;
  }

  // Other methods of StudentServiceWithDb
}
```

##### Constructor Injection

Annotate a constructor with @Autowired. Spring will use this constructor to
create
the bean and pass the required dependencies as constructor arguments.

> Constructor injection is considered a best practice

because it ensures that a bean is fully initialized when created.

```java
@Service
public class StudentServiceWithDb {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;
    private final StudentMapper studentMapper;

    @Autowired // Constructor Injection
    public StudentServiceWithDb(StudentRepository studentRepository, StudentMapper studentMapper) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
        this.studentMapper = studentMapper;
    }

    // Other methods of StudentServiceWithDb
}
```

Dependency Resolution: If there are multiple beans of the same type that can be
injected, Spring will perform
dependency resolution based on the bean's name (if provided) or type.

You can also use `@Qualifier` in conjunction  
with `@Autowired` to specify which bean to inject if there are multiple
candidates.

- `@Primary` - Multiple beans of the same type and one is intended to go in by *
  *default**
- `@Qualifier` - Used to specify which exact bean should be injected when
  multiple beans of the same type are available.
  It allows to explicitly select a bean by name or identifier

```java
public interface PaymentService {
    String processPayment();
}
```

The two implementations are

```java
@Service("creditCardService")
public class CreditCardPaymentService implements PaymentService{
    @Override
    public String processPayment() {
        return "Paid via credit card";
    }
}
```

```java
@Service("onlineBankingService")
public class OnlineBankingService implements PaymentService{
    @Override
    public String processPayment() {
        return "Paid via Online Banking";
    }
}
```

The use of `@Qualifier`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/payment")
public class PaymentController {
    private PaymentService creditCardpaymentService;//Can be resolved byNAme or with @Qualifier
    private final PaymentService onlineBankingpaymentService;

    @Autowired
    public PaymentController(@Qualifier("creditCardService") PaymentService creditCardPaymentService,
                             @Qualifier("onlineBankingService") PaymentService onlineBankingpaymentService) {
        this.creditCardpaymentService = creditCardPaymentService;
        this.onlineBankingpaymentService = onlineBankingpaymentService;
    }
    // Other methods of PaymentController
}
```

# Autowiring

#### byType - Class or Interface

- By Type (Interface): Use `@Qualifier` when there are multiple implementations
  of an interface and you need to specify which implementation should be
  injected.
  ```java
  private final SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;//SortAlgorithm Interface is implemented by multiple classes
  @Autowired//Optional for Constructor injection 
  public ComplexAlgorithmImpl(@Qualifier("bubbleSort") SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm) {
      this.sortAlgorithm = sortAlgorithm;
  }
  ```
- By Type (Class): Directly inject beans of a specific class when there is no
  ambiguity or when dealing with distinct classes.
  ```java
  private final StringService stringService;//Class
  private final NumberService numberService;//Class
  
  @Autowired
  public ServiceUser(StringService stringService, NumberService numberService) {
      this.stringService = stringService;
      this.numberService = numberService;
  }
  ```

#### byName

- if two Classes implement the same interface, the name is used to resolve the
  dependency
- or by the @Qualifier - use @Qualifier to specify which bean to inject when
  there are multiple implementations of an interface.

```java
@Component
public class QuickSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm {
  ...
}
@Component
@Qualifier("bubbleSort")//Qualifying byNAme
public class BubbleSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm {
  ...      
}
@Component
public class ComplexAlgorithmImpl { 
  @Autowired 
  private SortAlgorithm quickSortAlgorithm;//Resolution byName
    
  private final SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
  @Autowired //Constructor Injection using @Qualifier 
  public ComplexAlgorithmImpl(@Qualifier("bubbleSort") SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm) {
      this.sortAlgorithm = sortAlgorithm;
  }
  ...
}
```

#### constructor

- similar to `byType`, but through constuctor
-

# Exceptions

### `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`

- `@Component` missing
- or `@ComponentScan` not defined properly

### `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`

When there are multiple implementations of a single interface and is no declared

- `@Primary` or
- with `@Qualifier`

```java
@Component
public class QuickSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm{}

@Component
public class BubbleSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm {}

@Component
public class ComplexAlgorithmImpl {

  @Autowired
  private SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
  }
```
