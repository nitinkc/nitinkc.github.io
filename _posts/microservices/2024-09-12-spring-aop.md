Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring Boot is used to separate **cross-cutting concerns (like logging exceptions)**
from the business logic of an application.

Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules,
such as logging, security, and transaction management.

**Key Concepts**

## Aspect:

A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern.
It defines the code that should be executed at specific points in the
application.

## Join Point:

A point during the execution of the application where an aspect can be applied.
Examples include method execution, object instantiation, etc.

## Advice:

The **action** taken (method) by an aspect at a join point. There are several
types of advice:

- `Before`: Executes before the join point.
- `After`: (finally) advice - Always executed. Executes after the join point,
  regardless of the outcome.
- `After Returning`: Executes after the join point if it completes normally.
- `After Throwing`: Executes if the join point throws an exception.
- `Around`: Most powerful - Surrounds the join point, allowing you to modify its
  execution.

# Pointcut:

An **expression** that specifies where advice should be applied. It defines
which join points are matched by the advice.

# Weaving:

The process of integrating aspects into the codebase.
This can happen at various times, such as at compile-time, load-time, or
runtime.

# How AOP Works in Spring Boot

- **Define Aspects**: Create **classes** annotated with `**@Aspect**` that
  define the cross-cutting concerns.
- **Configure Pointcuts**: Specify where and when the advice should be applied **using pointcut expressions**.
- **Apply Advice**: Use annotations to define the **type of advice** and **associate** it with the pointcuts.

## Add Dependency

```yaml
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop'
```

## Define an aspect

On Class

- `@Aspect`: Marks the class as an aspect.
- `@Component`: Makes the aspect a Spring bean so that it can be detected by the
  Spring container.

On methods

- `@Before`: Defines advice to execute before methods in the specified package.
- `@After`: Defines advice to execute after methods in the specified package.
- `@Around` : The most flexible type of advice because it allows you to do
  things like
  change the method's return value, throw an exception, or completely prevent
  the method from running.

## Pointcut Expression:

`execution(* com.spring.reference.service.*.*(..))`

- execution(...): This is a pointcut **designator** that specifies which method
  executions the advice should apply to.
- `*`: Represents the **return type** of the method. Here, * is a wildcard that
  matches any return type.
- `com.spring.reference.service.*.*(..)`:
    - `com.spring.reference.service`: Specifies the **package** where the
      methods are located.
    - `*`: The first * represents **any class** within the specified package.
    - `*`: The second * represents **any method** name within the classes of the
      specified package.
    - `(..)`: Represents **any number of parameters** (including zero). The `..`
      wildcard matches any arguments.

# Example Code

```java
@Aspect @Component @Slf4j
public class LoggingAspect {
  @Before("execution(* com.spring.reference.service.*.*(..))")
  public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    log.info("AOP : Before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
  }

  @After("execution(* com.spring.reference.service.UserServiceForAOP.*(..))") //Adding a specific Class
  public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    log.info("AOP : After method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
  }

  @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.spring.reference.service.UserServiceForAOP.updateUserExceptionally(..))", throwing = "exception") //Adding a specific class and its specific method
  public void logAfterThrowing(JoinPoint joinPoint, Throwable exception) {
    log.error("AOP : Exception in method: {} with message: {}", joinPoint.getSignature().getName(), exception.getMessage());
  }

  @Around("execution(* com.spring.reference.service.UserServiceForAOP.*(..))")
  public Object logExecutionTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    Object proceed = null;
    try {
      // Proceed with the original method execution
      proceed = joinPoint.proceed();
    } finally {
      long executionTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
      log.info("AOP : Method {} executed in {} ms", joinPoint.getSignature(), executionTime);
    }

    return proceed;
  }
}
