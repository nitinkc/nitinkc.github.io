# Unit test Estimation

based on cyclomatic complexity as per sonarcube - if the cyclomatic complexity =
2679

* There are 2679 edges in the execution graph. Theoretically, at least one test
  case each node is needed.
* Meaning a minimum of 2679 test cases should be needed.

## Use of Cyclomatic Complexity:

* Determining the independent path executions thus proven to be very helpful for
  Developers and Testers.
* It can make sure that every path have been tested at least once.
* Thus help to focus more on uncovered paths. Code coverage can be improved.
