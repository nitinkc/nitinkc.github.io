The size of the thread pool that is used in Spring Boot

- by default, Tomcat uses a threadpool size of 200.
- It means that If 250 concurrent users hit spring boot application, 50 of them
  are going to wait for a platform thread to process their request

```yaml
spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
```
