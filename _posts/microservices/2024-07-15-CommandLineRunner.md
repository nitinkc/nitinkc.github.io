**@Order**: Specifies the execution order of this CommandLineRunner bean among
others.

- Lower values for Order execute before higher values or those without an Order
  specified.

**@ConditionalOnExpression**: Ensures that this CommandLineRunner bean is
registered only if the SpEL
expression `${runner1:false}` evaluates to true.

- This allows conditional registration based on application configuration.

# CommandLineRunner Interface

CommandLineRunner is a functional interface provided by Spring Boot. It contains
a single method:

```java
void run(String... args) throws Exception;
```

When a class implements CommandLineRunner, it must provide an implementation for
this run method.

- This method is automatically invoked by Spring Boot after the application
  context has been loaded and before the application starts running.
- This is useful for performing initialization tasks, setting up configurations,
  or executing any necessary operations that should occur at the beginning of
  the application lifecycle.

```java
@Component
@Slf4j
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Order(value = 1) //Sequence of runner
@ConditionalOnExpression("${runner1:false}") //Can be controlled from App yml 
public class Runner1 implements CommandLineRunner {
    //Make fine to be used with Required Args Constructor
    private final AnyServiceDependency anyServiceDependency;

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        log.info("Starting Runner 1");
        //Do processing
        doProcessing();
    }

    private void doProcessing() {
        //Write business logic
    }
}
```
