### Summary:
- Parent POM: Inherited via `<parent>`, shares plugins, properties, and dependency management.
- BOM: Imported via `<dependencyManagement>`, shares **only dependency versions**. No plugins or build config inheritance.Summary:

# Important Differences
A parent POM is a Maven project object model file (pom.xml) with `<packaging>pom</packaging>`. 

It can define shared configuration, plugins, properties, and dependency management.
Child projects inherit these settings by referencing the parent in their <parent> section. 

A BOM (Bill of Materials) is a **special POM** used only for dependency version management.
It is referenced in `<dependencyManagement>` (usually with `<type>pom</type>` and `<scope>import</scope>`), 
and only manages versions of dependencies, not plugins or build configuration. 

### Pushing the artifact on github packages:

If using local machine to push the artifact, use `settings.xml` of `.github/` folder

If using github's default file, ensure the project name matches the artifact name : [Commit](https://github.com/nitinkc/bv-core-platform-bom/commit/03901fce6184a8e34bc4f0b84f8ce5e96d4d60b6)

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username><github_id></username>
      <password><PAT></password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

### Using Jitpack to avoid publishing the artifact
[Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) is a package repository for JVM and Android projects.
