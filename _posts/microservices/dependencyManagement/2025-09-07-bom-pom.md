### Summary:
- Parent POM: Inherited via `<parent>`, shares plugins, properties, and dependency management.
- BOM: Imported via `<dependencyManagement>`, shares **only dependency versions**. No plugins or build config inheritance.Summary:

# Important Differences
A parent POM is a Maven project object model file (pom.xml) with `<packaging>pom</packaging>`. 

It can define shared configuration, plugins, properties, and dependency management.
Child projects inherit these settings by referencing the parent in their <parent> section. 

A BOM (Bill of Materials) is a **special POM** used only for dependency version management.
It is referenced in `<dependencyManagement>` (usually with `<type>pom</type>` and `<scope>import</scope>`), 
and only manages versions of dependencies, not plugins or build configuration.
