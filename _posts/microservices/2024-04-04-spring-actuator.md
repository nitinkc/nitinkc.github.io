@Slf4j
public class RedisHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
    @Override
    public Health health() {
        try (Jedis jedis = new Jedis("redis-server", 6379)) { // Update with your Redis host and port
            // Attempt to connect to Redis
            log.info("Ping redis-server on 6379 :: {}",jedis.ping());
            return Health.up()
                    .withDetail("status", "OK")
                    .withDetail("message", "Redis connection successful")
                    .build(); // Redis connection successful
        } catch (Exception e) {

## Check Health for Redis custom-url

http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/redis-health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/redis-health)

```json
"redis": {
"status": "UP",
"details": {
    "version": "7.2.4"
    }
},
"redis-health": {
"status": "UP",
"details": {
    "status": "OK",
    "message": "Redis connection successful",
    "version": "7.2.4",
    "os": "Linux 6.6.16-linuxkit x86_64",
    "tcp_port": "6379"
  }
}
```

The "redis" entry is provided by default by Spring Boot Actuator when it detects
that Redis is available as a dependency
It checks if the Redis connection is up by pinging the Redis server.

The "redis-health" entry is my custom health indicator RedisHealthIndicator.
This indicator checks the health of the Redis connection in more detail,
providing additional information
such as the version of Redis and a custom message indicating that the connection
to Redis was successful.

If you only want to see one entry, you can choose to use either the default
health indicator provided by
Spring Boot Actuator or your custom health indicator, depending on your
requirements.

If you prefer to use only your custom health indicator, you can disable the
default health indicators provided by Spring Boot Actuator.
